Where the Crawdads Sing,I stopped reading,1.0,"I managed to get halfway through this book. Thought it somewhat daft but then it leaped into improbability drive. I burst out laughing because it just became ludicrous and then gave up with it. Very, very silly,"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Stick With It,4.0,"Gradually abandoned by her family and shunned by the locals of Barkley Cove,Kya manages to eke out a living in the surrounding swampland.Although she is supported by Jumpin and his wife Mabel from Colored Town,their social status is barely above her own.Kya quickly becomes more at ease with nature than people and her relationships with the opposite sex are traumatic.Delia Owens' rich,descriptive prose gives us a valuable insight into the scenery and wildlife of the region but most importantly the intriguing character of Kya.I gave this four stars because the beginning was painfully slow,the poetry becomes annoying after a time and the timetable of events at the Fire Tower seemed implausible."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Boring about a girl walking through mud.,1.0,"The blurb of this book suggest an interesting crime thriller with twists and turns along the way. That couldn't be farther from the truth. The book - at least the first 100 pages of it - is just simply a little girl walking through mud. That's it, that's the plot. The dialogue is also horribly written, with the author writing down the pronunciations rather than just the words, essentially making it near impossible to read and understand, which in itself is incredibly frustrating. The murder part does happen, but it's not a big plot point, just randomly placed here and there to act as a break from reading about a girl walking through mud.As said above, I am currently only 100 pages in and already falling asleep every time I pick it up. I can see that the end of Part 1 is in sight, so I will keep going until then at least, but if nothing changes, I'm afraid I will have to stop reading.I don't usually quit on a book, but this one is so dull, frustrating to read and waffles on and on and on that I may just have to make an exception."
Where the Crawdads Sing,The most amazing book,5.0,"I was so looking forward to this book and I have to say it didn't disappoint.  The story is exceptionally well written.  The Author wraps all the characters around you so they are believable. The story is based around a girl left to survive on her own  deep in the marsh land of the Carolinas, where she has been abandoned, mistrusted  by almost everyone.  She manages to survive through many strife's until, years later,  there is a body found and villagers, not knowing what else to do, point the finger at the Marsh girl they have come to fear over the years ....  I will say, the story had me hooked from page one and it was finished within 24 hours!!!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Croak, Croak",3.0,"When a female friend I trust recommended this book, I downloaded it without hesitation, but was then overcome by misgivings that I had let myself in for a cloying dose of chick lit. The opening of the novel, written in barely comprehensible Deep Southern dialect, did not reassure me; it almost stopped me in my tracks, but I persevered and did not regret it even though the story line is preposterous. That Kya, a six-year-old girl, would be serially abandoned by her mother, brother and father, leaving her to  bring herself up alone in a swamp while evading the legitimate benign interest of the social services stretches credulity to the limit. However, her history is told with such vim and affection for place and time that one is drawn into the fantasy with the added incentive of having a mystery to solve once the little girl has grown to a woman of twenty-two. The novel switches from the past to present almost every alternate chapter, which helps to sustain interest in both the history and the mystery. Anyone, like me, who has pursued a career in the natural sciences will be drawn to the author’s portrayal of Kya’s passion for ecology, which saves her from maddening isolation. There is a lonely corner in everyone’s life where a Kya-like figure might inhabit, and her sexual awakening is described in such painfully frank and realistic detail that it helps to reconnect suspended belief. The patient detective work and the courtroom drama are also well woven into the narrative. However, there was too great a tendency in the novel towards exaggerated wish fulfilment to avoid the taste of saccharine overwhelming my sensitive palate. Amongst other things, abandoned and deprived children almost never thrive, vanishingly few amateur naturalists (Jane Goodall being the exception) outshine the professionals and not all people from ethnic minorities are warm and generous; to imply otherwise does injustice to reality. Moreover, the outcome of the mystery is so telegraphed that it becomes more of a whydunnit than a whodunnit. After all, Where the Crawdads Sing is politically correct chick lit, albeit extremely well-crafted and endearing even to an old curmudgeon like me."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Why is it that everybody thinks this book is so good?,1.0,"Let’s take the positive to start with.  The swampy meandering prose conveys a good sense of place.BUT, the characterisation is is universally unappealing and unconvincing.  As a result, you end up not caring what happens next.  The coming of age theme has the smuttiness normally associated with such a theme.  The ethology theme seems artificial and too clever by half.  This is a contrived book written, I suspect, for people who would want to think that they are lapping up a flavour of the swamps and marshes of North Carolina without ever straying from the air conditioned comfort of their strictly tarmac-ed existences.  I don’t normally complain about lack of authenticity in novels - novels are fiction after all - but this is pretentious un-authenticity!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Nicely written.,3.0,"I enjoyed most of this book, and it was nicely written so it was quite easy to ignore some of the more irritating things, like constant head-hopping, and the fact that the main character's situation was a bit far-fetched. Her sudden change from wild child to (quite prim) author of brilliantly-received books was a bit of a jump; I'd have preferred to have read a little more about how it happened, that might have made it more believable. I thought that was brushed aside too quickly, and meant I didn't really experience it the way a reader should.The murder storyline held me for a while, but ultimately it was no surprise when I found the 'twist.' It was kind of telegraphed.The characters, which should have been the driving force behind what seemed like a literary novel at first, were mostly flat and cliched;  that was a disappointment; much more could have been made of them, which would have enriched the reading experience. The brother coming and going was a bit pointless and went nowhere, and the white-hat/black-hat aspect of the two young men in Kya's life was another cliche that brought the rating down.The writing was often startlingly good, there were many sentences which really sang, but overall it all felt a bit cobbled together, and the intrigue felt shoe-horned in. Also it did feel a bit like a nature lesson at times, with the descriptions nicely done but unnecessary, and delivered in a very lecture-like way. Not as they'd be viewed from the 'Swamp Girl's' perspective.Overall then, I liked the writing, and the premise was promising, but I don't think it quite delivered in the end."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Quite weak,1.0,Was highly recommended by most people yet I ploughed through wishing it would end.Very unrealistic ending and an overall story not believable at all.Probably more suitable for high school reading.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Not well written!,1.0,Pretty awful!
Where the Crawdads Sing,A unique and moving first novel,5.0,"Wow..…..this first novel really has polarised opinion!  I read it because it was recommended by a friend.  If I had seen the reviews first – especially the US ones – I might not have bothered.  I am extremely glad that I did.They say you should write what you know –  for your first attempt at least –  and that is just what Delia Owens has done with Where the Crawdads Sing.  The book is therefore a mix of story, poetry, murder-mystery and expert scientific understanding of fauna and flora.  I found it to be a fascinating combination.The story line is ambitious, with two simultaneous timelines – the earlier one stretching over the years from 1952 onwards, and the second starting at 1969.  The first line gradually catches up with the second, until they merge into a satisfying denouement.I would agree with those who say that the story – of a little girl abandoned to fend for herself in the marshland of North Carolina and her subsequent emergence into an expert in her scientific field, despite only one day at school in her life – is highly unlikely……  but so what?  This is, after all, a work of fiction which draws on the rich imagination of the author, coupled with her own knowledge and experience.  Many of the best works of fiction go beyond likelihood – look at most of Dickens’ novels – and thank goodness they do.I wonder if the American readers found it hard to take the portrayal of prejudice against the main character and of racism in general, which we all know was endemic at that time.  The British have learned to regard the constant criticism of their colonial past with the composure of a people confident in their long and largely illustrious history.  Perhaps the more recently rooted Americans need longer to cease trying to prove themselves.  For whatever the reason, I was shocked to see the thousands who agreed with the vitriol of some of the US reviewers.Do read this book.  It is totally unique.  It is at times very moving, and it is a superb first novel."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Where the Crawdads Sing is a deep and moving novel that I have no doubt I will forever remember.,5.0,"It is a mind-blowingly poignant debut and easily one of the best books I have read so far in 2020. This is exactly the kind of novel that will the first in my mind when I think of recommendations.The story begins with a six-year old girl living in a shack by the marshes and swamps, near the coast of North Carolina. Though she faces many disheartening and painful traumas from a young age, Kya matures into a beautiful and intelligent young woman. She learns to become industrious, relying on her talents and knowledge of the marshland to survive. However, after years of fending for herself, Kya has a natural guard up, save for a small number of trustworthy allies… and the gulls. The town of Barkley Cove labels her the ‘Marsh Girl’, and all eyes point to Kya when ‘golden boy’ Chase is found dead among the everglades.I love Kya’s independence. She’s a character that’s incredibly easy to connect to, even as a reader I found myself feeling protective over this young girl. While she is sensitive and timid, she has a fierceness that’s admirable. And her courage, agility and intuition add to her brilliance as a protagonist. I also deeply appreciate the way the author interweaved poetry with Kya’s thoughts and emotions. Furthermore, the significance of poetry to the principal figure plays out magnificently. When reading, Kya feels so real it’s almost natural to smile or frown when she does.Secondary characters, like Tate, Jumpin’, Mabel and Jodie infused life into the tale of Kya. They’re an additional layer to this charming coming of age story. The characters’ reflections and musings have an emotive depth that makes each of them feel earnestly human. But above all, Kya is the extraordinary personality, and one I’d happily revisit.Owens’ rich and eloquent reflection on humanity paints a vivid picture from the first page. The author’s passion and understanding of nature is evident in her splendidly descriptive poetic prose. As a zoologist, the author’s fascination with ethology becomes addictive. In Where the Crawdads Sing, Kya develops a love of collecting shells and feathers as she grows up. Correspondingly, Owens turns from an author to an artist as she creates a world that’s easy to dive into and fun to explore.Her writing floats between a thick intensity and an empathetic calmness that makes it near-impossible to forget. I found the atmosphere of 1960s North Carolina effortless to imagine. Owens’ expertise and familiarity of the natural world also gave me a refreshing outlook on life and value. While the plot of Where the Crawdads Sing is very impassioned and rousing, it’s the author’s elegantly revealing voice that will remain sharp in my mind.Where the Crawdads Sing is in two sections, Part I – The Marsh, and Part II – The Swamp. The chapters alternate between 1952 and the murder trial in 1970. With each chapter, the years grow closer, while the tension and uncertainty deepen. As a reader, my heart was pounding during the final chapters the same way I imagine Kya’s was. It’s truly a gripping and exhilarating read.And although the narrative is written in the third person, the tone never feels shallow. Where the Crawdads Sing has the qualities of a run-of-the-mill murder mystery. But what makes it stand out is the emotive power and alluring rhythm. The story slowly draws you in, the emotion keeps you hooked, and the characters create the connection. It’s the recipe for a perfect plot, and exceeds all my expectations.Originally, this isn’t a book I originally planned on reviewing. Where the Crawdads Sing has suffered the curse of being stuck on the TBR list for way too long. But when I think of this novel now, I only wonder why I didn’t read it sooner. It’s a moving and inspiring story about survival against the odds. Themes of family, love, prejudice, poverty and loneliness are insightfully explored in this truly gripping story. There is diversity in the characters, the style and the emotion. It’s not only a novel that will have you sobbing by the last page, but also stuck in awe and wonder at the natural beauty of Delia Owens’ words and descriptions.“Go as far as you can – way out yonder where the crawdads sing.”Anika | chaptersofmay.com"
Where the Crawdads Sing,A novel of two parts ...,2.0,"As a former North Carolina resident, I was looking forward to reading this novel.  At the start it did not disappoint.  Early on, I cared so much about Kya's fate that I had to take a peek at the book's end to see if she survived!  However, about  two-thirds of the way through I began to notice a change.  From chapter 30  Kya began quoting the mediocre poetry of ""Amanda Hamilton"", whom she had never mentioned before.  These passages added nothing to the book and were so irritating that I gave up reading them.  There were also longer passages of dialogue, whose language seemed to me unnatural and stilted.  Would a reunited backwoods brother and sister really talk to one another like two professors discussing an academic paper?  The whole ""what happened to Ma"" scenario was unnecessary and added little to the story,  Kia seemed change overnight from a simple and sensuous nature lover to a respected and erudite academic authority.  Sometimes a book is written in stages and it seemed to me that the marked change in tone could be due to that.  Or was there a new editor at this stage?  However, on the whole,  the nearer I got to the end, the more improbable the plot became and the less I cared about Kia's endless flitting about the marsh, or Big Red, or the Courtroom cat, or Tate's blond curls, or ""who killed the Hockey Jock"".  Plot holes galore, especially in the unmentioned matter of how many bus tickets would be purchased for TWO return journeys and how Kia become a Master of Disguise .. What began as a five-star read had, sadly, become a two-star by the final page."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Unrealistic,1.0,"Presents the natural scenery very nicely but when it comes to the characters, it resolves the human part of them in a very simplistic way, sometimes in 1 line, so after describing the swamp in detail, you are left with, whats going on? The whole situation of the main character is unrealistic, from her living conditions, to not going to school and then to becoming an author.... oh well."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Mesmerising coming of age story of a lonely young girl living on the marshy North Carolina coast.,4.0,"Delia Owen’s first fictional novel tells the immersive story of the so called “Marsh Girl”, Catherine Danielle Clark, known as Kya and is an extraordinary story of a young woman’s survival and self-reliance in the marshy coastland of Barkley Cove, North Carolina.  Delivering Kya’s heroic journey alone would be enough to fill any book but Owens excels in her descriptions of the vivid setting which I found enlightening and also explores the profound loneliness that sees Kya reach out for a connection and eventually sees her implicated in a murder trial.Spanning 1952 to 1970, Kya’s story begins as a six-year-old, the youngest of five children living in a shack in the remote marshland of a backwater town.  Accustomed and in tune with the natural world around her she draws comfort from singing to the gulls and exploring the wilderness when her mother abandons her at the age of six, swiftly followed by all four of her siblings.  Left in the company of her truculent drinker of a father she is shown no love and quickly leans to fend for herself and so when he predictably disappears at the age of ten, Kya is left alone and forced to become self-sufficient in order to survive.Derided as swamp trash and traumatised by the experience of a single day at the local school she finds acceptance in the natural world around her and remains alone until she is befriended by sensitive and sincere local teenager, Tate Walker, four years her senior and as drawn to the magic of the marshlands as Kya.  Taught to read and trust by Tate, Kya’s only other support comes from black husband and wife, Jumpin’ and Mabel, who can empathise with the prejudice she is faced with and to whom her loneliness ie evident.  Abandoned by Tate after he leave for college, Kya retreats further into the world where she is happiest and learns valuable lessons about life in the rhythms, patterns and animal life in her marshy homeland from mating to nurturing their offspring.  Tentatively daring to trust again despite bearing the scars of Tate’s betrayal, the interest of the handsome but manipulative character of Chase Andrews sees him begin visiting Kya on her own territory and making hollow promises, only for her to eventually learn of his engagement in the local newspaper.The novel opens with the discovery of the body of local golden boy and star quarterback, Chase Andrews, in the marsh in 1969 and Kya’s story is intercut by the investigation of Sheriff Ed Jackson spurred on by Chase’s mother who is quick to send them in the ‘marsh girls’ direction, aided by local rumours and abetted by a string of prejudiced witnesses pointed in the intended direction.Although the likelihood of a ten-year-old being left alone, escaping local authorities and learning to cope without interference is easier to accept in 1960s remote small town America, Kya’s rapid development from basic reading and arithmetic into self-taught acclaimed naturalist, published author and leading light on the landscape around her really does take some believing.  It would be easy to quibble about the implausibilities of the story and to lament the black and white characterisation which makes it pretty clear from the off who the goodies and baddies in Kya’s story are but there is something wholly enchanting about Owens story.  Despite reservations, and the predictability of the ending with Kya’s romantic reunion inevitable and obvious, the suspense around the murder trial and Kya’s innocence endures until the very last and in the most fitting of tributes, the natural world around her closes ranks to protect her secrets.Tender and emotive I enjoyed the novel for what is was, namely a poignant story of one extraordinary young woman’s journey against a multitude of obstacles and bigoted options in her way.  The descriptions of nature are illuminating, the setting inspires a mesmerising atmosphere and Kya’s story is a magical one which will stay with me."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Disappointing,3.0,"After reading so many positive reviews I had such high hopes for this book but was sadly disappointed. Parts of it are beautifully written and I really enjoyed the descriptions of the marshes, estuaries and animals. This is where Delia Owens knowledge really comes into play. Sadly however, the plot itself I found weak, far fetched and at times ridiculous! A child raises herself alone, from the age of 6 but never gets sick, needs to see a dentist and manages to stay healthy despite eating grits everyday! Not for me"
Where the Crawdads Sing,A fabulous enigmatic experience.,5.0,"I have just finished reading, 'Where the Crawdads Sing' by Delia Owens. A first novel by an American scientist who spent much time in Africa and who has produced several best selling non-fiction books.It tells the tale of a seven year old girl who lives with her family in a tumble down property, situated in marshland. Father is a drunk and is violent towards his wife and children until one by one they all leave. Kya is alone and has to survive. Her story is magical, scarey, gentle, violent and presses all emotional buttons for loads of different reasons. She becomes at one with the birds and learns how to dodge school authorities. She explores the creeks on her small boat and finds a friend in Tate, a young man from the small town. He teaches her to read and write and agently and slowly a love affair emerges. However he leaves for university and Chase begins to call. Not quite so kind.This sounds so ordinary when I read it through, but in fact it is the most wonderful manuscript. Incredibly well written! Unputdownable, for sure! Magnetic with the sea, sky and call of the birds. The author portrays the magical atmosphere of the times so beautifully, even through a murder trial. This is one novel I shall be sure to read over again. Superb.🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟."
Where the Crawdads Sing,This book is so badly written it made my teeth hurt,1.0,"If a cliche had sex with a box of fondant fancies - this would be the prodgeny.  Possibly the worst book I have ever read. More adjectives than you can throw a pelican at - alliterative adjectives to boot.  How this has become a best seller is beyond me. Appalling, illiterate, non sensical, unrealistic, ill conceived, drivel."
Where the Crawdads Sing,This dense limey needs a glossary!,3.0,"This book was all over the reviews along with the dreaded words “really popular with book clubs”.  I tackled it without having a clue what a crawdad was, and I really struggled as a non-American with a lot of the words, dialect and above all the names of the stupendously ghastly sounding poor white southern food. Disclaimer; in the interests of fairness and research I once ate grits.  The best comparison I can make is that it was rather like eating lumpy wallpaper paste.  I do find that some books set in the rural US would benefit foreign readers if they did have a glossary! But that is my problem.  I was also completely mystified by the ubiquitous biscuits that appeared (along with grits) at most meals.  I had to Google in order to work out why one would eat biscuits (as Europeans understand them) with everything!It appears to be very much a marmite book, with some US reviewers pointing out all sorts of things that are simply lost on non-Americans.  They really lay into it about the accents, names, education system, conduct of justice and things that I’m simply not qualified to comment on.  I noted that the author was a wildlife writer, and that did shine through.  What hit me immediately however was how similar it felt to Barbara Kingsolver’s Prodigal Summer. This was a lockdown recommend from a friend who loved it and had spent quite a lot of time living in North America.  While I think it was a better novel, more structured, with more layers and a more believable and intricate plot, it didn’t really float my boat, although I did enjoy it (and had less problems with understanding it!)  But I kept ticking the comparisons.I appreciate that with all the many thousands of reviews out there, writing this is a spurious exercise.  However, I actually enjoyed it quite a lot on a superficial level.  As a novel/whodunnit it might not have been of the first order, and there were gaping plot holes and improbabilities.  As another reviewer has said, being eaten by alligators was clearly too good for the father.  I felt that a point was being made that previously well connected and bourgeois folk could end up at the bottom of the heap, reviled and ignored.  I have no idea how the US social system works (although it did imply that there was one) and whether or not it was wildly unrealistic to have a sort of jungle child who, with the aid of a decent boy, was able to self-educate to professorial levels.  I suspect highly unlikely.  Like the heroine in Prodigal Summer, Kya had supernatural abilities when it came to identifying random bird feathers and was of course an expert tracker, and naturalist, as well as being wildly beautiful with amazing hair (check again Prodigal Summer!)I liked the fact that the Sheriff and his side kick were thorough, meticulous and as it turned out, right! They could have been portrayed as ignorant swamp town hicks.  All right, they failed to make a watertight case, but the magically appearing pro bono ace lawyer was the one who really did for them.It wasn’t a terribly good book, but that didn’t stop me guiltily enjoying it and not being that surprised at the reveal.  I kind of guessed a crawdad might have some connection to crayfish, so that’s a new piece of natural knowledge I’ve gained at any rate. I’d briefly travelled down the Outer Banks, and been to a couple of American swamp areas, so I enjoyed the nature descriptions and was surprised at being told the age of most of the buildings in the settlements. Then I remembered Roanoke and the earliest settlers.  Not really a 4 star book, but I enjoyed it more than 3, so 3 and a half if I could.  Lots of people will enjoy it."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Good read, but does not bear too much plot analysis",3.0,"There are so many things to like about this book - interesting setting, well-written characters, absorbing plot, lyrical writing.  Such a pity, then, that it is spoilt by a weak denouement to the murder mystery, with a storyline that has so many holes it could be crocheted. Some of them are so easily remedied that the Editor ought to be taken and shot (ok - extreme, just a turn of phrase.) Also,  Amanda Hamilton's 'poetry' should have been left out. The character Amanda Hamilton adds nothing to the plot, her poetry is woeful and when it is quoted it feels as shoe-horned-in as an Abba song in Mama Mia (the movie).  Again, the Editor should have dealt with this (kindly). These few tweaks could have made the difference between Where the Crawdads Sing becoming a modern classic in the style of To Kill a Mockingbird (yup, that good) and simply being a mass-market pot-boiler, which is what it is, sadly."
Where the Crawdads Sing,It’s trite,1.0,"I hated this book pretty much from the beginning....it’s a ridiculous premise and in no way reads as either possible or probable...Everything about it was annoying, important issues skated over or dealt with in a couple of paragraphs then never mentioned again and the characters were completely cliche.The only people I would recommend this to are hormonal teenagers...perhaps not even them.."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Incredibly overhyped,1.0,Novel is easy to read but so unrealistic that I could not suspend disbelief. Odd portrayals of responses to trauma and lots of tired literary tropes used.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Dreadful,1.0,"After all the rave reviews I was so looking forward to this book. The gushing praise for the writer's lyrical descriptions of nature had me hoping for something akin to Thomas Hardy. What I actually got was Virginia Andrews on a bad day. Clunky, unrealistic dialogue, thinly drawn, 1D characters and cliche upon cliche that made me almost cringe myself inside out. Huge disappointment."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Interesting read,3.0,"I very much enjoyed the wonderful descriptions of the landscapes and coastal scenery of North Carolina.  There were detailed descriptions of the flora and fauna, and Delia Owens is obviously passionate about this and very knowledgeable.  I was not so keen on the story, although I felt it was just about feasible, but really it was a vehicle for  an in depth look at the ecology of the area.  I warmed to Kya, but felt it was very unlikely that without any formal education she would have become, not only an expert re her homeland, but also a famous author and something of a classics scholar too.  Just stretching the bounds of credibility a bit far.  Also I was shocked by the twist at the end, though I should have expected it - others in the book group thought it was quite predictable."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A beautiful and moving book,5.0,"The Introduction, set in 1969, has a poetic description of the marshes and swamps near the coast of North Carolina – a foretaste of many other poetic descriptions of nature in the novel. It also ends with the discovery of the corpse of one Chase Andrews in a swamp, and that is a foretaste of a murder mystery.The chapters alternate between the times following the discovery of the body and times after 1952, in which the first chapter is set.The central figure of the novel is Kya (Catherine) Clark, at this point aged six, the youngest of five children.  Kya’s father is a violent drunk, and her much-loved mother, who was educated and a painter, could no longer stand his attacks.  She left, abandoning her children.  Kya’s four elder siblings also cannot stand their father, and, before long, they leave also, (including Jodie, her favourite brother), leaving Kya alone with her father; and he was almost always out, playing poker and drinking whisky and, in 1956, when Kya was ten, he disappeared altogether.  The truant officers had taken to school, but she hated being with so many people and attended only one day, and later hid from the truant officers until they gave up.Her loneliness is in part self-inflicted:  she is frightened of most other people (except for the friendly black couple who ran a local store), and tends to hide herself from them.  She is illiterate, but she loves, and is knowledgeable about, all the fauna and flora around her, and she had a fine collection of feathers, shells and other such objects, and had done wonderful drawings and paintings of them.She made a little money for her barest necessities by collecting and selling sacksful of mussels.Back in 1953 she had come across Tate Walker, then aged eleven, who shared her enthusiasm for the fauna and flora of the marshes.  Seven years later, he gently courted the timid girl, and she responded. He tactfully taught her to read, and even to appreciate poetry, and the book has her reciting many poems by heart.  She read voraciously, especially scientific books about nature. When, at the age of fifteen,  she has her first period cramps, it is Tate who has to explain to  her what they are.  There is a tender awakening of physical love between them. Out of respect for her youth, Tate did not go the whole way, though both of them longed for it.  And then he had to go away to college to study biology.  He promised to be back at Thanksgiving – but he never turned up.  Now her loneliness was the worst of heart aches.Four years passed; she is now nineteen. She was then spotted by Chase Andrews, the handsome village Lothario. He, too, courted her, and eventually she responded to his advances. They now met frequently. After a year, he talked of marrying her, and then she surrendered her virginity to him. And then she saw in a local newspaper the announcement of his engagement to another woman. This did not stop him, when next they ran across each other, from trying to rape her, and she only escaped after a violent struggle.Tate had reappeared to warn her about Chase, and things now seem to improve for her. Tate persuaded her to let him send some of her nature pictures to a publisher, who was enthusiastic; and for  the first time she had a fair amount of money and was able to modernize her shack.She showed her gratitude to Tate, of course; but the hurt he had caused her meant that she could still not trust him;  and often she hid when she saw him rowing in the marsh.All seems to be going well – but all this while we have had chapters about how the sheriff and his deputy have been looking for clues who might have killed Chase.  Though Kya seems to have an alibi for the night Chase died, the clues seem to point towards Kya, and in 1969 she was charged with his murder.  We are about two-thirds through the book.I must not reveal what happened from then onwards, except to say that at the very end, after Kya has died in 2010 at the age of 64, we learn two astonishing things about her.Some of the few negative reviews of this book have said that in many ways it is hard to believe in it – and I agree. But if you can suspend your occasional disbelief, this is a quite wonderful, beautiful and moving book."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Beautifully Descriptive Writing, Coupled with Unique & Memorable Characters!",5.0,"Wow. This book has some of the most beautiful writing I’ve read in a while. The descriptions are so rich, and they actually move the story along. I was easily pulled inside the story, into the marsh. The mystery of Chase Andrews was kind of secondary to everything else.The themes of loneliness, abandonment, isolation run through the whole book, and there are times when Kya just breaks your heart. She is so fragile, so vulnerable; but she is also incredibly strong and brave. I love her. She’s a great protagonist. Jumpin’ is fab, also. He really looks out for Kya. And, Tate. Ahh, lovely Tate. As well as being a story about loneliness, it’s also a love story that is wonderful to watch as it unfolds.I absolutely loved this book. It is full of unique and memorable characters. The writing is first class. The descriptions, out of this world. A fantastic book, through and through!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Wish I had never bothered to invest my time and emotions.,1.0,"Fell for the hype, and was initially surprised by how much I actually loved this book.  However, I have never been so disappointed by the ending of a novel.  For me it made everything that had gone before seem like a total con-trick, and it all turned to ashes - what a waste of time, seriously don't bother."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Disappointed, given it's popularity",2.0,"I’m afraid that “Where the Crawdads Sing”, did very little for me. I wondered at first if it was the place I was at in myself but I don’t think so. I found a lot of the descriptive passages, which at first and on the surface seemed beautiful, become more contrived as the novel went on. That soon started to irritate me. The young girl Kya and her life from 7 to 12 just stretched credibility too far for me.  In addition I never found her to be the most sympathetic of characters. The murder mystery aspect was fine but all in all the book disappointed me."
Where the Crawdads Sing,The worst “Great Book” I have ever read,1.0,"It’s a lesson I still haven’t. A book with Great Hype does not make a Great Book. Crawdads is the perfect example. 17,000+ reviews on Amazon.com. A rating of 4.8. It has to be an excellent book. Surely. No. This is a poor book, flimsily constructed with weak characters and an implausible plot.Although targeted at adults, it’s basically a Young Adult Coming-of-Age Romance with only three characters. Kya, a girl who at six years old is abandoned by her mother and then a few years later by her father too and therefore has to fend for herself in the swamps of North Carolina. Tate (perfect body, dark eyes, golden hair), is a young boy from the local town who falls in love with her and teaches her to read. And Chase (perfect body, dark eyes, but DARK hair), is a young boy from the local town who falls in love with her and whose body is later discovered at the bottom of a fire tower amid suspicious circumstances. So who killed Chase? In a book with only three characters, and one of them is dead, that doesn’t leave a lot of room for surprises.The book is also totally unbelievable. Tate teaches Kya English when she’s 14 years old. A few years later, Kya walks into the town library and asks for the Principles of Organic Chemistry by Geissman, Invertebrate Zoology of the Coastal Marsh by Jones, and Fundamentals of Ecology by Odum! She then writes – and has accepted for publication – a scientific paper! This is not only implausible but a huge insult to researchers who have had to study hard for years to achieve the same goal.Moreover, she lives by herself in the swamp but never gets ill, never suffers from malnutrition, her boat never breaks down. The dialogue is trite and simplistic. Finally, the minor characters are so weakly drawn as to be invisible. So we have cops who, surprise surprise, like eating donuts, and a cliché-spewing “wise” African-American woman.I could go on, but I’ve wasted enough time reading this thing. Thankfully I gave up after 51%."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Well worth reading.,5.0,"I’ve been putting off reading this book as although it’s been raved about it just didn’t seem the kind of book I’d like. I was so wrong, in part it’s a book about a murder but really it’s about society, relationships, nature, our environment, social interactions and so much more. It’s well written, beautifully written and one of those novels that each person will get something different out of, depending on the person reading it and what they personally bring to the experience. Getting a bit deep now but this book was such a pleasure and torture to read that it’s an experience not just a book and one that keeps popping up in your mind long after you’ve finished it, or should I say devour it as once started it’s hard to not keep reading even if you really should get to sleep as you have work in the morning."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Utter nonsense,1.0,"Silly plot, unbelievable characters. Tedious."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Cliche ridden ridiculous story,2.0,"I read this for a book club, otherwise I would definitely not have finished the book. It was not the quality of writing that I normally read.The story was really unbelieveable. A young girl left to fend for herself in the wilds. Suspending disbelief, the description of her wonderful eyes, gorgeous, long black hair, slender waist was so cliche'ed, and along with the kindly old black man, his fat lovely wife, the tall handsome suitors....really! Had this young girl really been living on the kinds of scavenged foods described, she would have had poor skin and bad teeth! The passage where the young lad was able to inform her about periods was ridiculous! And why didn't she get pregnant?In my view, the only redeeming part was the end when it was revealed that........but I won't spoil it for anyone who might want to read it!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Bodice-ripper whodunit that doesn't quite match the hype.,4.0,"This period piece murder mystery, albeit being an undeniable page-turner, was a frustrating one to read. I was well aware of the hype, and had friends who rated it highly. For the first 60 or more pages, i was spellbound. I was starting to think it was for real - maybe we had the next Harper Lee on our hands. The story has hallmarks of her style, small town, rather prejudiced southern United States mixed race community, with analogous characters, the heroine child,  handful of good men and women, both black and white, and many of lower character. The courtroom drama.Sadly, after its promising start, it falls into a series of cliched traps which bodice rippers and whodunits often suffer from, the ""thrusting manhood"" scenes, the manufactured tension, the stereotypes - the plot holes are sometimes glaring. I wont give these away but they are there in abundance. And the lack of credibility. A totally illiterate and innumerate girl auto didacts to PhD level, seemingly within a year or two, assisted by a lad who visits her shack occasionally.The police process described seems patently ridiculous. The denouement is literally on just about the last page , and is manifestly implausible, leaving about 15 major questions unanswered.It's a real shame. This book was actually an enjoyable read, and had the potential to be far greater than it is. It promised so much at first. I believe Owens does have a great deal  of prose talent (although perhaps less poetic talent - the pages are littered with poetaster verse of dubious standard ), but it sometimes descended into routine bodice-ripper and whodunit territory and could sometimes be downright clumsy.Have a go - see whether you agree with me!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Destination Hallmark,1.0,"I have no doubt whatsoever that this novel will one day inspire a Hallmark film. A beautiful actress will play the feral wild child and start a trend for naming baby girls ‘Kya’. This is ‘chick lit’, trying hard to be more. I have no explanation for the overwhelmingly positive reviews on Amazon. Congratulations to Delia Owens who is laughing all the way to the bank!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Stunning!,5.0,"I finished Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens a couple of weeks ago, and I can’t stop thinking about it. When I first started reading it, I wasn’t expecting to be pulled as deeply into the novel as I was, it took me totally by surprise. I was captivated by the story of ‘The Marsh Girl,’ and I loved Delia Owen’s writing, which transports you to the marshland's atmospheric setting.Kya is one of the most memorable characters I’ve come across in a long while. She lives with her family on the outskirts of the nearby town, surrounded by marshland. From a young age, things are tough for Kya. Unable to live with her father any more, her mother abandons her and the rest of the family when Kya is very small. Soon her older siblings follow their mothers lead, leaving Kya alone with her abusive father. But Kya knows her father well, and she manages to co-exist with him over the next few years, until the day when he doesn’t come back.I felt so frustrated for Kya. I couldn’t understand why the rest of her family had abandoned her, particularly her siblings, who could have taken her with them. It seemed so unfair that she was the one left behind at such a young age. Because of this, Kya has to grow up first. She has to provide for herself after her father abandons her as well. Kya also becomes the topic of a lot of gossip among the locals. That’s how she earns the nickname, ‘The Marsh Girl.’This novel isn’t a fast-paced read. When I was reading it, I decided I wanted to take my time with it as I was enjoying the writing so much. We flick backwards and forwards from the late fifties and early sixties to 1969. In 1969 the body of a young man has been found. But we get to learn more about the background of this man in the scenes from earlier years. What is his connection to Kya? I wanted to find out what the connection was, and I wanted to know why he had ended up dead? The police are treating his death as a murder, although some believe it was a tragic accident. But the police want to wrap the case up quickly.There were moments towards the end of this book where I was literally holding my breath as I waited to find out what was going to happen next. Kya was the one character who I rooted for throughout the book. I wanted her to succeed in life and to find someone to spend her life with.Where the Crawdads Sing is a masterpiece, it’s haunting, and it is beautifully written. It is one of the best novels I’ve read in a long while. I’m sure I’ll be thinking about this book for a long time to come. I highly, highly recommend it!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Fascinating but flawed SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW,3.0,"This book started out with so much promise - the stunning descriptions of the marshland and the extremely likeable character of Kya, the little girl who is abandoned by family and lives alone in a run down shack drew me in easily. But it veers between evocative language that hauls the reader into her world and clunky plotting that made me cringe.She is taught to read in a single session, skipping merrily from being introduced to the alphabet to a complex sentence full of blended phonics, consonant digraphs and modifying vowels. This scene shattered my belief in the story and I started to notice the far-fetched plotting more.The boy who adores her and promises to return changes his mind for the sketchiest of reasons to create a bit of mid-novel tension, then changes it back again for equally unprompted reasons, so that all can end well. It would have taken very little to strengthen this plot strand but it read as though the author was pretty bored by the mechanics of storytelling and just wanted to explore the marshlands without the onerous task of creating a realistic narrative. The dialogue in the love scenes reads as a cut and paste from a Mills & Boon. Characterisation vanishes. And, given this is nominally a murder mystery, the local police are bafflingly dim. Having lived all their lives in swampland, it takes them months to work out that tidal water might have washed away any footprints from the scene of the crime.Despite these criticisms, the landscape is so vivid, so stunning that I felt lost inside it while reading the novel and for that alone, I'm glad the book was recommended to me. Few novels suck you into their world so completely as this one did. The long passages of descriptions of Kya in nature, combatting her loneliness by focusing on the land were really compelling."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautifully written touching story,5.0,I was aborbed by this book from the moment I started it.  So well written that I could almost smell the sea breeze and hear the gulls above me.  Centres around the tragically lonely life of a child left in her poverty stricken home as one by one her siblings leave her behind.  Her fight for survival is sometimes heartbreaking but sometimes made me chuckle.  I found myself. even sometimes .envying her natural peaceful existence at one with nature.  Of course she ends up tough and  beautiful but her rollercoaster fortunes keep you page turning.  I won't give away the end by it found myself sobbing on my sunbed and eagerly wondering who would pay this fantastic character in the screenplay that has to follow.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Where The Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens,5.0,"Whilst reading this novel I kept thinking of the book Winter's Bone by Daniel Woodrell. Both stories broke my heart exposing human suffering from cruelty, prejudice and poverty.Kya is a young girl who has brought herself up on the Marshlands.  She avoids school and the authorities by hiding and making up excuses for her parent's absence when fetching supplies from town. She works out who to avoid and who she can go to for help.Even when her family lived with her it was hard. They all suffered terrible violence from their father.  He spent most of his days drinking.  Yet, she still has fond memories of her mother.  The thought of seeing her mother again gets her through life along with her amazing spirit for survival.  We watch her grow up into a beautiful, self sufficient woman.The main plot is about the body of a local man being found and whether or not is was murder.  Kya becomes the main suspect after some of the townsfolk talk to the Sheriff.This is Delia Owen’s debut novel although she has written wildlife books as an expert scientist. This comes through plentiful in the novel.  If you love learning about nature you will love this. The descriptions are intense and detailed. I had to read them twice sometimes to help me imagine the environment.I related to Kya’s solitary life. I like my own company and socialising is a nightmare to me too. I would rather curl up in bed with the cat and a book. Socialising is dangerous as people can be harsh and hurtful and I really get that.  The book like Winter’s Bone reminds us of the poverty going on right under our noses. Maybe like the folk of Barkley Cove we should ask ourselves do we do reach out? or do we judge?In conclusion I would recommend this book if you like description and beautiful writing along with your murder mystery.  Even the book cover is beautiful.  There is plenty of bird and plant life references which makes for an unusual and interesting read."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Incredible. A must read.,5.0,"A quick scan of my previous reviews (momobookdiary-com) will show that I read crime fiction and romance fiction - rarely much else gets my attention. This book caught my eye on various times and places.  Most recently a friend was reading it and I decided that I too needed to read it.  I knew NOTHING of the book - didn't what it was about, where or when it was set - NOTHING. I liked the cover and many many people were reading and talking about how good it was.  Then I received my copy and saw it was set in 1969 I feared I had made a mistake - I don't read books set in the past.... but I wanted to give it a chance so started reading - and couldn't stop until I reached the end. I am so glad I read this incredible book - and you should too!The author’s outstanding knowledge and understanding of nature and the natural world is evident by the beautiful descriptive emotional writing.I had tears in my eyes many times throughout the story which pulled at my emotions. Reading the book during the Covid-19 isolation period made the setting of the book seem even more relevant today. This story takes us back to a time when the world moved at a slower pace and right now it feels like the earth is being given a chance to recover whilst we all stop and I think it is much needed - for the earth as much as for us humans.I envisage this novel becoming a 'classic' which will be read again and again in the future. I believe there is a lot we can learn from this novel about the world we live in.  Everyone should read this book.  It is a story of survival, of prejudice, of poverty, of isolation and loneliness, and of nature and humanity. There is mystery. There is love. There is heartache. There is hope.Congratulations Delia Owens on an epic first novel. Thank you for sharing with us this insight into your knowledge and experiences. I look forward to reading your next novel when it is released.... there will be a next one, right?"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Disappointing,2.0,"⭐️⭐️ starsI caved and read this one even though it’s never appealed to me but everyone I knew recommended it!It started well and I loved the chapters of Kay as a kid. Even though they were ridiculously implausible (boating and bartering at 7?)But then when she became an adult the book changed for me - too much poetry, too much overly descriptive narrative about nature, birds etc.I couldn’t gel with any of the main characters but Jumpin & Mabel were great.The Chase storyline just felt off and I truly had no interest in what happened to him.Not for me sorry!!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Boring! Disappointing! Unbelievable!,1.0,"So, I think the title I’ve given my review says it all. This book is very hard going! The storyline, characters and plot are underdeveloped and unbelievable and I was bored with it early on. I kept going with it, hopeful that it would pull me in and grip me at some point, but the boredom continued right through to the end.  It was a relief to finish it, but it left me feeling disappointed I’d wasted my time reading it. From the reviews, lots of people have enjoyed reading this book, but if you’re struggling with it and just hoping it gets better, don’t bother - it doesn’t !!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Astounding, Extraordinary, Startling",5.0,"The writing is so intense, so beautifuly descriptive, not only do you feel like you are with 'Kya' but you 'love' her and want her to be safe and happy with every line.The book takes you over, it becomes the only thing you must do that day 'Read'.The story of survival against the odds, how cruel a society is to 'diffence' and mostly the cost of 'love'.The plants and birds and 'Life' in the Marsh was something that I thought I would rush through, how wrong I was, I slowed down, absorbing all the natural beauty of Delia's words and descriptions.Wonderful book, I brought on my Kindle for 99p, this is a book that I must have sat proudly on my bookshelf, so will now order it and will recommend to all I know!!!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Unrealistic clichéd and predictable.,2.0,"Sadly spent a number of hours of my life reading this clichéd drivel.  Ridiculously unrealistic  to expect a 7 year old to survive alone in a swamp let alone be taught English then biology by a slightly better off boy, fall in love, gets broken heart, ends up being used etc etc. It drags on and on to the inevitable but predictable outcome which I won't spoil but suffice to say that the ""murder"" plot is also hair brained and lacking in detail. Thoroughly unsatisfactory."
Where the Crawdads Sing,The touch of a great writer,5.0,"Delia Owens’ ""Where the Crawdads sing"" is a best-seller. It doesn’t just say so on the cover : it really is a best-seller, and I am very glad that it should be. It’s got everything : social consciousness, condemnation of racism, exposure of domestic abuse, a detective story, a court drama, scathing exposure of snobbery, but also displays of generosity, kindness and humanity.The main character is Catherine, nicknamed Kya. She is brutalized by an alcoholic father whom everyone avoids, including her own mother. In the end, she is left to live alone in a shack at the age of six, in the middle of the North Carolina marshes. Somehow, she manages to survive. While doing so, she unwittingly becomes an expert on marshland : its waterways, vegetation, fauna and marine life.You would think that the good, righteous, church-going citizens of Barkley Cove, the nearest small town, would instinctively have organized help for this abandoned child… Not a bit. She is “white trash”, barely above the status of animals. Kya shows up at school, one day, only to be ridiculed and rejected by the other children. The teacher, who could have shown some Christian compassion (makes you wonder if there is such a thing) does nothing to discourage the little bullies. Kya will never go back to school after that. Paradoxically, the only person who develops a soft spot for Kya, is the county truancy officer. She can’t help admiring the ingenuity and survival skills of the child.Kya grows up alone, with the reputation of a being a wild child. Soon, she is known only as The Marsh Girl, which means, of course, that when a young brutal and arrogant football player is found dead, she becomes the ideal suspect.Two rays of sunshine in her dark life : Tate, a boy who is a few years older than her, and who teaches her how to read and write. There is also a black couple who run a small boat service station cum grocery shop on the wharf.Kya loves, understands and studies the marsh ; to the extent that she manages to have several books published on the subject.What props and sustains the plot and the characters, is Delia Owens’ style. Such beautiful, fluid, poetic prose ! As a reader, you are made to see, hear, smell, taste, touch and feel the mash. To the five senses Delia Owens ads the sixth sense of dreams and exaltation. She is not just a great writer : she is also a scientist. Her style is clear ; the structures of the story are impeccably constructed, all the way to the unexpected twist at the end.We have more than a masterpiece, here : we have what will become an American classic."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Kept me reading until the end.,5.0,"I have just read a remarkable book by Delia Owens.  Ms Owens is an acclaimed wildlife scientist and has written bestselling non-fiction about her time studying wildlife in Africa.  She uses all her love and knowledge of wildlife to set the scene for her first work of fiction 'Where the Crawdads Sing'.Townspeople in Barkley Cove talk of the Marsh Girl, who is sometimes seen boating along the marshes of the North Carolina coast.  As a child Kya Clark was left abandoned when first her mentally ill mother walked out of the family home, and then subsequently her alcoholic father.  She learns to cook and fend for herself, and grows to love her surroundings and the wildlife that inhabit the marshes.  Illiterate, she collects feathers and shells, but shuns school after attending for just one day and being bullied.One person brings light to her life. A boy, Tate, who also loves the marshlands.  He leaves feathers  for her to add to her collection, and she gradually learns to trust him over many years.  However, circumstances change, and Chase Andrews comes into her life when Kya is grown.What happens to Chase also runs through this book, and adds a 'whodunnit' interest to this story. The townsfolk are against the Marsh Girl, and they instruct their children not to go anywhere near her.  They are sure she had a hand in Chase's ultimate fate.Is Kya just marsh trash, or a poor abandoned soul looking for love?  Have a read of this wonderful book, and you won't be able to put it down.  No wonder it's now being made into a film!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautiful descriptions and great plot,5.0,"This was chosen as my latest bookclub read. I picked it up immediately after reading Shuggie Brown, a story about a child living with harsh neglect and abuse so, at the beginning of this book, it seemed to take a relatively soft approach to Kya's world. I needed a few chapters to settle into what would become a wonderful rhythm within the narrative of the story.Kay's life is guided by the seasons and the natural world around her which is charming and it is clear that the descriptions of nature are a big part of this book. Many of the phrases jump out of the text, one example being ""Autumn was coming: the evergreens might not have noticed but the sycamore did""The book is presented as two separate time periods. They don't fit naturally at the start but gradually come closer. They show different perspectives of the same area and they engage the reader in disparate ways. As the plots develop the earlier time catches up and we see more background to the death of Chase Andrews.Poems feature within the narrative as Kya becomes aware of the outside world and its culture. This highlights further the poetic qualities within the regular narrative.At its heart this is a crime story but the descriptions of the natural world raise up the level of the book. The prose are deep and gorgeous, allowing the reader to see the world through Kya's eyes.Wonderfully, there is also a thoroughly satisfying ending which is one of the best compliments that a book can receive."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautiful poignant story with some minor criticisms,4.0,"“Where the Crawdads Sing” follows Kya, the ‘Marsh Girl’ from 1952.She was abandoned by her family as a small child. She survives with gulls for company on the marsh in North Carolina. She is largely shunned by society and faces poverty and loneliness. She survives with limited support from black shop owners Jumpin and his wife Mabel, also a boy called Tate, who luckily looks out for her and later becomes her lover.The story also follows another time line (1969) which starts with the death and possible murder of town golden boy, Chase Andrews.The book covers a child surviving on the marsh, her later limited romantic encounters, a murder mystery and a court- room drama.I absolutely loved the descriptions of nature on the marsh, the vegetation, insects and birds, the mud and the sand… The marsh permeates the story from start to finish.I also loved Kya’s spirit throughout the book.She develops a total understanding of her environment, learns to read and eventually to write authoritative scientific books about the marsh.I enjoyed the murder mystery with its’ few possible endings and the court case was well done.I do however have some minor criticisms as I did find some of the story- lines totally implausible. Kya grows into an absolutely beautiful and exceptionally clever young woman… She is also ‘lucky’ in some ways especially having someone patient enough to teach her to read!!I also found some parts of the book, especially the romance sections, full of clichés….I do however realise that it is fiction and the story is beautifully poignant. It is a book that I won’t forget. My book group gave it the highest score of any book we have read!!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Memorable but not sure I'd recommend it,3.0,"I was recommended this book by a friend.  I initially started to read it soon after I bought it but stopped as this sort of book requires time and concentration to read and I was too busy to set aside this time.  However with a second lockdown I picked it up again.  The description of life in the swamps of Carolina is beautifully written.  The description of nature and the wildlife interesting and the author paints the picture well, however I did find myself at times think - ok enough with the description, I can see where and how she lives , now can we continue with the story. The jump forward in time and the little bits of the future story did not seem to match the descriptive writing of Kya's childhood and young adult hood.  It is definitely a book of two halves almost to the point of two voices.  The description and the young life of Kya and then the court case. This is certainly a book that will stick in my memory for a long time but I felt the book as a whole was rather contrived and unbelievable. The fact that this waive manages to survive unaided and become an accomplished author seems a step too far.  I can understand that someone in her position understands the life around her, in her immediate vicinity, the nature she sees but survives so well unaided - perhaps not.  The end maybe has a twist but again it really pushes believability!  I think at best I would say a beautifully written book about the swamp-life but an overly romantic story."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautifully written,5.0,"A beautiful book in so many ways.A book about a young child, Kya, who is abandoned by all those she loves. Her poor, suffering mother (how could she?), and finally all her siblings. She is left with her no good father, an abusive drunk. However, they survive together because they are all they have, until eventually he too leaves and never comes back and Kya is on her own in the family home, little more than a shack on the edges of the marsh. The marsh becomes Kya's salvation and in return, she studies the wildlife and records and documents the creatures that live alongside her.The loneliness and sadness seep out of the pages, 'I burst into tears and sob and sob. I feel so desperately alone.' As does the beauty of the place, 'bark on the tree like dead skin cells.'Kya does eventually have encounters with other people as she grows older and stronger. Some are good and some are not. She even finds love, which comes with its own problems.There is a murder mystery as part of the plot, however who really killed Chase Andrews is secondary to the whole story. This is much more about survival and hope and growth against bigoted views and prejudice. It is a description of the waterways and marsh and the life that teems within and how life survives on the margins."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Brilliant.,5.0,"Where the Crawdads Sing is going to be one of my top ten books of the year. I can say that with absolute confidence.It is the gorgeous story of Kya Clark who has been utterly let down by life. Everyone has abandoned her and she has been shunned by the local townsfolk. However, she raises herself on the land. It is only when one true friendship comes along that she really begins to change her opinion of and her belief in herself.However, old judgements are always going to plague this town and when a local man – celebrated in his teens for being a sports star and the fact that he has come from a well to do family – is found dead the finger of blame is firmly pointed at Kya. Where the Crawdads Sing is a beautiful story the looks a small town mentality and how prejudices are formed and sustained. The beautiful lyrical style of Delia Owens’ writing manages to immerse you in the story immediately. I began to read the book more quickly because I needed to know what happened yet I cursed myself for reading it too quickly because I didn’t want it to end. Where the Crawdads Sing is one of those magical books that makes you feel so much.Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens is available now."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Hands down THE BEST BOOK I have read in the last decade! A true literary  journey,5.0,"Wow!!!! And i mean WOW!!This has been a revelation of a book! I haven’t been this emotionally invested in a book in i cant even remember how long!Quite possibly THE BEST BOOK I've read in the LAST DECADE. And believe me, it is a very tough read at times, very very tough, but boy! You truly go on a journey with Kya. I mean WOW.I haven't stayed up late reading a book until the wee hours of the morning, unable to put it down.It has taken my breath away. And even though my smart arse bookworm brain tried to guess the plot and where it would all end, this book definitely didn't follow the usual linear path. The last fee chapters i read holding my breath.Critiquing a book is very much an ambiguous activity for it completely depends on the tastes of the reader.And some may have read this book and found it wanting, but for me, WOW. I will NOT forget it.Its about resilience, survival, connection to nature, human spirit, human nature, discovery, hardship...i could go on....This is a BEFORE and AFTER book for me. Like The Eight by Katherine Neville was over 3 decades ago and Outlander not long after that. One of those books that stays with you forever.Thank you Delia Owens 🙏🏼"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Review,4.0,"I've heard a lot about Where The Crawdads Sing this year and I really wanted  to see what everyone is talking about for myself. Firstly, Owens' writing is absolutely beautiful and it conjures up wonderful images of the marsh and the lifestyle of Kya and her family which really helped me to connect emotionally with the story. The novel is also peppered with beautiful poetry that definitely increased my ability to picture Kya's surroundings.The reader first meets Kya when she is a young child and the novel follows her journey into adulthood. It did take a while for the story to gel with me, but once it did, I was fully immersed in Kya's life and the emotional turn of events. I loved seeing her grow. There were several moments where I wanted to jump inside the book and give her a hug. She is definitely a character who will stay in my mind long after this review is published.As the plot progressed, I really wanted to know what would happen to Kya, and this makes some parts of the novel very tense. The author certainly gives us a lot to think about, and the ending fits the tone of the whole novel perfectly."
Where the Crawdads Sing,My Best Read this Year,5.0,"Every now and then I select a book sonewhat removed from the usual categories which make up most of my library. This is one such case and boy am I glad I took a punt.The storyline is captivating and the skill with which it is constructed is peerless. There is such a feeling of sensitivity about the way that Kya`s early life appalling experiences are related that total immersion in her character and her life becomes impossible to avoid.What strikes me as quite remarkable is how she finds beauty and solice amidst her surroundings despite all the negative and life quenching, appalling events and circumstances that surround her.Thankfully, to restore our faith in human nature, there are just one or two hero / heroines who support her with acts of simple human kindness whilst the majority of the township folk and institutions simply turn there back on the little Marsh Girl.I read with pleasure how, with a little help, she finds an avenue for her life's work and along with supported self eduction reaches the pinnacle of published author and renowned expert in her field of study.Yes, she got away with murder, but what other choice did she have?Little to no chance of being believed if she'd tried to bring rape charges against Chase and his clear threat to have the last word, a kill or be killed dilemna.Trouble now is what to follow this book up with that will provide half the reading satisfaction..."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Where The Author Sings.,5.0,"I cannot believe I clicked past this book so many times eventually selecting some second or third rate book. Where The Crawdads Sing is an astonishingly accomplished novel featuring one of the finest drawn characters in literature. Kya is three dimensional and true to life. Her psychology is utterly convincing and, unlike that in lesser books, does not bend and creak to accommodate the story. Her shack stands as an apt image for her character : unassuming on the outside, complex, growing and dynamic on the outside.Some of the imagery is exquisite: "" Clouds lazed in the folded arms of the hills"" drew an entire landscape for me. The book is full of such gorgeous, stunning, apposite word pictures. There is some poetry in the novel but it is testament to the author's writing that it is less poetic than the prose. I can't emphasis enough: the prose is superb.Delia Owens' day-job expertise subtly permeates the novel, filling out Kya's and the swamp's elemental nature, as well as breathing enchantment, conviction and education into this reader's brain.I suspect the black haired swamp girl will be with me for a long time."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Lyrical and profoundly moving,5.0,"Unless you have been living under a literary rock for the past few months, I’m sure you have heard of this book. You’ve probably already read it, as I seem to be a little late to the party but, if not, I suggest you pick up a copy as soon as possible because this is one of the best things I have read for a long while and will definitely be one of my top books of 2020.This is the story of Kya, a young girl abandoned at a young age in the marshes of North Carolina who learns how to survive on her own by studying the wildlife that surrounds her on all sides. Her life is touched by a few souls from the nearby town, but largely she is an outcast, misunderstood and feared by local residents so, when a local man is murdered in the marsh, she is the prime suspect.This book is a masterpiece in so many ways. It begins as a mystery story with the body of the man discovered in the marsh, so we are immediately engrossed in trying to discover, along with the local police, who is responsible. In this way we are introduced to Kya, the ‘Marsh Girl,’ an outsider who has lived alone in the marsh since she was a child and who is deeply misunderstood by the local townsfolk. The book then runs along two timelines, the current investigation of the murder, and Kya’s past as she grows up in the marsh. The  mystery is compelling and involves many twists and turns and false paths, so the reader can’t really know who did it until the very end. However, despite the fact the mystery is well-developed, this is probably the aspect of the novel that drew me the least.The things that make this book so special are the exploration of Kya as a character and how she survives alone in the marsh from childhood and how this life affects her emotionally, and the vivid and immersive descriptions of the landscape and nature of the marsh where the book is set. The author writes so captivatingly and movingly about both that the reader cannot help but be swept away in the story.The development of Kya’s story from her abandonment by her entire family as a young child and how she has to learn to survive alone in a hostile environment with very little contact with or help from her nearest neighbours is tender, believable and completely heart-breaking. It is a damning commentary on the way society frowns upon anyone who chooses to live a lifestyle outside the mainstream and how such choices invite disdain and a cold-shoulder. How people are largely concerned only with themselves and quick to ignore problems they don’t want to address. The only people who have the good heart to help Kya are others who are similarly shunned for their differences, or who want to use her for their own ends.Kya is a fascinating and wholly endearing character. Her stalwart determination to survive alone, learning from the creatures that surround her, adapting their habits and survival skills to help her and, in doing so, falling in love with the life and creatures of the marsh and studying them in a way few people ever do. The way the author draws parallels between humans and the wildlife of the marsh and uses those parallels to inform the reader about both is deft and clever. We fall in love with both Kya and her delicate and unique environment and come to care deeply about the survival and protection of both by the end of the book.The marsh, then, is an integral part of the book, as essential to the story as any of the characters. In fact, it becomes a character in its own right, as intricately described and developed as any of the human participants, a living, breathing organism that is vital to Kya’s happiness and well-being in a way no human has ever been. It is the one thing she loves, trusts and knows will never let her down. Their lives are so intertwined that, when she is forcibly separated from it, it feels like a form of death to her. Like removing a fish from the ocean, she feels like she cannot breathe. If you ever wanted to read a book that really transports you to an environment you have probably never experienced but into which you will completely disappear, this is the novel for you.The writer’s prose is lyrical and flowing. I know some people have found the book a little slow, and it is true that is is very descriptive and languid, but this is a huge part of the beauty of the novel and, if you stick with it, I am sure you will find the whole story as beautiful, heart-rending but, ultimately, uplifting as I did. The languorous nature of the prose is entirely fitting to the plot and the setting, mirroring the slow, warm, unchanging days in the Carolinas and will envelope you in the mindset if you let it. Just kick back and go with the flow and let this exceptional novel float you on a magical journey that will leave you fundamentally affected by it."
Where the Crawdads Sing,very poor,1.0,did not like this book one bit utter rubish
Where the Crawdads Sing,Loneliness defeated.,5.0,"With over 100000 reviews already published, I am sure that this review will add nothing new. Nonetheless I am glad to add my voice in praise of an exceptional book. Delia Owens is a well respected academic. She has published in ""Nature"" which is one of the world's leading research journals. She is a renowned naturalist. This knowledge base shines through in ""Crawdads."" In this, her first novel, the plot is skillfully woven and the descriptions of American marsh land are captivating. The language is a delight. Set in the deep South of America, there are some parallels with ""To kill a mocking bird."" In essence the story tells of the survival of a young girl when deserted in the middle of swamp land. She does survive, encounters love and becomes an acclaimed author. The book explores the problems of deep South America before black Americans were given their freedom. It details the problems of loneliness and abandonment. It is permeated throughout with a profound love of nature and the relationship between man and creation. A must read book."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Absolutely dreadful,1.0,"I read this as a book club read, otherwise I would have abandoned it after a few chapters - life is too short!The overall impression is of very immature writing. Steeped in cliche, the prose is amateurish and repetitive. Why it has such rave reviews I cannot imagine. That's several hours of my life I will not get back.I recommend you read just about anything else other than this rubbish."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Mixed feelings, but a decent first novel",3.0,"I've read a lot of Southern literature and always enjoy finding a new author. Based on glowing tributes, I probably expected too much from this book.The Good: It is written quite well, and as a piece of Southern literature it compares well with more middle-of-the-road authors. The murder mystery aspect is quite well thought-out, and the pattern of flitting between the past and the present is knitted together quite well. The final denouement was handled well. Altogether, a decent summer read.The Bad: At times elements were almost forced into the fiction - the zoology of coastal Carolinas is fascinating, but too often read like a textbook. The ""romance"" in the middle part of the book was way too Mills & Boon. The coastal vernacular was a bit too patronising, and, I believe inaccurate. Other details about North Carolina were a bit implausible and seemed to have lacked background research. (I lived in the North Carolina coastal plain for 10 years, so know it fairly well).Overall, I'd probably give a second novel a chance, though currently there are many other Southern writers I'd read first."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Hearbreakingly beautiful,5.0,"This book enveloped me from the start, I have not been able to put it down. I found her characters were well drawn and believable. The protagonist Kya, was a true child of nature. Her early childhood was tough and when she is finally abandoned, Kya finds ways to survive. I find her wholly believable, children can be exceptionally resourceful. The subtle nuances of the storyline, constantly draws parallels between Kya's situation and nature. She is a highly intelligent girl, picking up reading skills from Tate, the young lad who has always been in the fringes of her existence. She goes on to become a leading authority on the flora and fauna of the swamp marshes. What I like is the constant tension of the wildness of Kya, at one with the animals and birds of the swamp, and this other life amongst civilisation where she will never fit in. I find this book inspiring and it is a testament to leaving some habitats and civilisations alone. Kya dealt with the main threat to her way of life, using lessons from nature, she ensured her own safety. I want a hard copy of this book, having it on kindle isn't enough, it was a wonderful read and now I feel like I have said goodbye to an old friend."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Captivating.,4.0,"A captivating story of a young girl abandoned by her family and shunned by her neighbours. Kya runs native in the marshes and lagoons of her North Carolina home.The depictions of landscape, wildlife, flora and fauna were exquisite. It is no surprise to learn the the author is a renowned naturalist. Kya’s journey from timid and vulnerable child to wary, unsocialised woman is very well drawn. Her inner life was compellingly believable.I could have done without the crime and courtroom aspects of the story although they were exciting. Kya’s journey would have been enough for me.The cast of small town characters added colour,  but, with a couple of notable exceptions, the gulls and herons peopled the neighbourhood more sympathetically. It did not help that the dialogue came across as stilted and wooden. The writer is clearly more comfortable in a world peopled by nature, the weather, the sea and stars."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Richly deserved plaudits,4.0,"The plaudits are in, and richly deserved.  It's always interesting, when a debut novel scores this highly, to have a peek at the one star reviews.  In this case, the dissatisfied readers appear to be largely academics who cannot abide the thought of a poorly educated girl becoming largely self taught and finally accepted as a world authority in her subject.  These moaners should be reminded of Mary Anning, a real life girl who, with no education at all to speak of, is now recognised as one of the finest paleontologists of all time.  I too have a couple of minor moans about the Crawdads.  It was careless of the author, in what is otherwise a beautifully crafted novel, to put her heroine in the dock without a shred of evidence against her apart from the suspicions of a few villagers.  This was more Salem than late 20th century justice and I am puzzled by it.  And the poetry, as others have commented, is just dire."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautiful writing style,4.0,"Delia Owens has a uniquely beautiful writing style. Meticulously detailed and picturesque, setting each and every scene to transport the reader into the world of Kya, a young girl living in the Marsh.When she occasionally inserts extracts of poetry she finds ways of evoking thoughts and emotions that even her own beautiful writing could not have achieved. It is breathtakingly genius.Owens takes considerable time to allow the reader to familiarise with the characters of the novel, particularly Kya. This is usually a quality I am drawn to in a novel, but I did feel that the first third of the book gave just a little too much time with Kya and her uneventful surroundings, and I didn’t engage until the story began moving at a quickened pace.At a guess, I would say that Owens was heavily influenced by one of my favourite novels, To Kill a Mockingbird. I found myself drawing strong parallels between the way in which both authors utilise innocence, naivity and youth to challenge the strong prejudice present in the societies depicted in both novels.Having said that, there was more than one moment where I audibly gasped...so despite the obvious influences, Owens still managed to shock and surprise.This book was oh so almost perfection...with love and heart-ache, strong characterisation, beautifully unique story-telling and an element of mystery and with just a slightly quicker hook at the start I couldn’t have faulted it."
Where the Crawdads Sing,The best book I have read in a long time.,5.0,"I  rarely enjoy fiction that is outside crime, police procedural and psychological thrillers. However, I'm so pleased that I followed a recommendation from a friend to read this book. I was engaged from page 1 to the end. The depiction of the swamp land and the life that Kaya was left to live there was spellbinding. The characters were well drawn and the story built to an interesting conclusion. I'm surprised & sorry that this is Delia Owens' s debut novel as I would love to read more. If you are a fan of Barbara Kingsolver then you should enjoy this. A brilliant debut which I cannot praise enough."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A beautiful and captivating book,5.0,"This is such a beautiful and captivating book. Kya is one of the most interesting and endearing characters I have come across in a novel and I loved following her story from a very young girl right through to the end of her life.Her strength and resilience permeates through the story despite the many challenges she faces, such as fending for herself when members of her family abandon her one by one, being an outsider to other children her age, dealing with the almost mythical ""marsh girl"" label she is given, the rumours surrounding her and most notably being accused of murder.I loved the beautiful love story at the centre of Kya's narrative which was believable and well constructed and the addition of the ""murder mystery"" element provided a level of mystery and intrigue which drove the plot forward.A thoroughly enjoyable read and I cannot wait to read more by this author."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Sublime. I loved it,5.0,"📚📚Book review 📚📚💫💫📚Where The Crawdads Sing📚💫💫 Delia Owens  💫💫📖 Kya Clark has spent most of her life living in the marshes of North Carolina on her own after her family desert her 📖My heart broke for Kya who from a young age was left by all her family members to fend for herself in a shack on the edge of the marshes in a small community in North Carolina. Her resolve and determination to survive on her own isolated from those around her was so thought provoking.  A few local people help Kya out now and then but most days she spends her time in the marshes with the wildlife and the nature she found there. As she grows she makes friends with Tate who also shares her love of the marshes. He also leaves her to pursue a life and career of his own but the ties they had prove difficult to break. 💕She then meets Chase and as their relationship grown Kya’s dreams of love and companionship comes to an abrupt halt. Chase’s death leads local prejudice against Kya for being different to directly affect her future. By the end of the book we see Kya’s life lived as she so wanted it to be and she finds comfort and calm from the nature in the environment she so loves.I adored this book, it’s a coming of age of someone who is different to others but whose passion drives them to find solace and love in nature. I am not surprised the author is a wildlife scientist - the importance of nature in the book is forefront to the story and her passion for that comes across. 🐚🌸.I loved Kya - a resilient, courageous young woman who yearned for those around her to accept her for what she is but ultimately lived  the life she wanted in her younger years without that understanding. She did what she wanted to do and loved what she wanted to love 💓  I think she will stay with me for quite a while 🤗I would give this book 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟💫a 5 plus star read. 🤗🤗 it is sublime  😍"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Riveting reading,5.0,"A book that holds your attention from the start. Every time you think the plot is going down an obvious route it surprises you, and each character is beautifully drawn and believable. But over and above everything is the extraordinary detail and observation of the marshland where the central character lives and the descriptions of the wildlife and the atmosphere of the environment. Breathtakingly observant and irresistible even if you are not normally a nature fan. And, yes, I am sure there are people who have survived like Kya in what seems like impossible circumstances but it is powerful stuff."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A society misfit overcomes life changing trauma to emerge triumphant,5.0,"The story of Kya , the Marsh Girl, abandoned by her family & society at the age of 6. Left to fend entirely for herself in an alien environment , she not only survives but triumphs in life to become a renowned author & scientist. This doesn’t happen without great personal cost, alienating Kya from anyone who tries to befriend her, engage her, help her.An amazingly evocative story set in a landscape far from a reader’s experience & sadly , yet again , highlighting American society that rejects anyone outside a perceived norm, even a 6 year old abandoned child. The first people to offer help are themselves marginalised , Jumpin’ & Mabel are black, working class, but even they are not as despised as Kya, their nickname is friendly, hers is a derogatory  term of abuse.Throughout the novel lines of inspirational poetry are quoted & it is only in the last chapter that the source of the poems is revealed.An unforgettable novel , especially as it is Delia Owens first novel."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautiful Book,5.0,"I heard so much about how wonderful this book was, but never really understood what it was about, so here goes...A young girl born into extreme poverty in the 1950’s America learns to survive. Her life is described along with the nature surrounding her. So beautifully, that you almost envy her. I certainly envied parts of life that she experienced, parts that most of us don’t see. Woven into the story is a crime that’s committed, linked to the nearby town, in the 1960’s. As she grows the stories link together. I loved this book. I loved the story of her life, I felt for her and cared for her. I worried about her, my heart broke and then soared for her. I also learnt interesting facts about firefly’s and other ‘sneaky f**kers’, lol 😂 A must read for anyone who loves to visualise a book and really feel for the characters."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Destined to be a modern classic,5.0,"Deserves to be up there with To Kill A Mockingbird. Wonderful evocation of the place, using her skills and knowledge from studying wildlife, Delia Owens tells a love story - love of nature, discovering boys - for Kya, a girl who survives in the marshes as her family all leave home to escape a violent father. The prose is immaculate. The story both emotionally tugging as well as absorbing. Ultimately, there is a murder and the investigation and the court scene are conducted well, not spoiling the story but adding a new dimension to it. This is the best book I have read this year (and I have read some crackers). My wife has read it and we are in full agreement over its qualities. I have purchased copies for others, a rare thing for me to do, but I want them to have the same enjoyment I have had."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Original writing,5.0,"I loved this book, the story refreshingly different, as was the writing.  Delia avoids repeating cliches, she doesn't speak of people walking together in ""amicable silence"", a cliche I hate, but makes her own words to describe such a scene, as she does with ""dust motes in sunlight"" another cliche in writing, her own description is original, thereby making the observer's thought authentic.Every character is distinct in appearance and personality as is Sunday Justice the cat who befriended Kya when she refused all contact with a human world but desperately needed a fellow living creature to share her loneliness.  I loved Sunday Justice's way of saying goodbye, and the way his tail told is thoughts.The end is a surprise, but it shouldn't be, the clues were there!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Rubbish,1.0,"I gave up after 33 pages. The plot is simply too silly: a six-year old left by mother, siblings, father to fend for herself. No grown-ups in village nearby  seem to care a bit. Grown-ups are not that stupid, not in the 50s, not even in the USA."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A book for 2020,5.0,"I was put off reading this book because of some very bad reviews.  Looking now at the same reviews they are completely unjustified and seem to be deliberately hostile.  My daughter was reading the book and said it was wonderful so I started to read it.  I was drawn in immediately by the language of the characters and could almost hear them speak.  The descriptions of the the marsh drew beautiful  pictures for the reader and the treatment of environmental, class, and race issues was particularly relevant to the present. Equally important was the exploration of domestic abuse and what we would now recognise a PTSD.  The issues in the novel speak loudly to us in 2020 and show how far we still have to go to create equal and sustainable societies."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A big hit with our book club,5.0,"Our book club, the Gloucestershire Lit Lovers and Yummy Scrummy Pudding Club really loved this month’s book ‘Where the Crawdads Sing’ by Delia Owens. It is a perfect book for anyone who wants to escape from life at the moment (due to Covid-19!) We all imagined being out in Kya’s boat traveling across the marshes of the Outer Banks of North Carolina, rather than being in self-isolation at home.The main character will win your heart. Abandoned by her family as a young child, Kya learns to fend for herself. The animals and birds become her family, and her reason for going on. We felt quite emotional for her and about her.We totally recommend this beautifully written and atmospheric book, which was set in the 1950s and 60s."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Surprising Plot Twist,4.0,"This book follows the story of Kya or the ‘Marsh Girl’ who lives in a quiet town, Barkley Cove. She was abandoned early in life and lives isolated and cast out from society. In 1969, Chase Andrews is found dead, and the locals immediately suspect Kya, despite the lack of evidence. It follows the heart-breaking story of her dealing with the prejudice and harsh realities that comes with being classed as different by society. It’s written as a dual-timeline story, following Kyas life growing up alongside the unravelling of Chase’s murder and the aftermath of his death.I loved the story this book told and was surprised at how much sympathy I felt for Kya, but the small moments of happiness in her life made you smile. I thought that the ending would be predictable, but I was super surprised with the twist at the end when I was proved wrong. I wasn’t disappointed at ALL. The reason I marked it down a star is that I struggled to originally get into it. The only point where I couldn’t put it down was when her case was taken to trial in the court! I just needed to know what happened."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Fabulous read!,5.0,"This was a great book.  I was caught in from the first page and couldn't put it down.  It is a while since I have had such a satisfying read, all the books released now seem to be so formulaic and follow a theme.  Oh, let's shine a light on this or that issue when most of us just want to escape into an absorbing piece of literature that takes us out of our rather 'groundhog day lives' - well certainly in lockdown.  Rant over; and just want to say read this book, you won't regret it!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Nature, Murder, Mystery.",3.0,"I bought this book after reading some glowing reviews....and was left a little disappointed. The evocation of the landscape and the insights and portraits of the natural world are beautifully and lightly done - as you would expect from an author who is foremost a zoologist - but while Delia Owens excels at capturing the wild she doesn’t have much of an ear for human dialogue or pinning down descriptions of human behaviour and the expository description of the town and its folk at times seems a little naive and childlike.As an aide - there is a fascinating article in the New Yorker called “The Hunted” about the unsolved murder in Zambia of a poacher from over 30 years ago, that allegedly involved Delia Owen’s former husband and stepson, which the publishers would seem rather keen we don’t allude to."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Exquisite,5.0,"I'd heard good things about this book, and I dove in not even having read the blurb. I was not disappointed.I won't post sent spoilers, but this book is spectacular. Set in Georgia, the gorgeous accents are written into the dialogue, making you feel like you're right there in the marsh with the characters.Each personality is beautifully brought to life, allowing me to know every one as if we've met before.Without giving anything away, this book is absolutely phenomenal from start to perfect finish, and will forever be one of my favourites. The story flows so smoothly that you won't even notice when it is suddenly four o'clock in the morning and you're sat on your bed, mouth open in shock with tears streaming down your cheeks and your heart in tiny little pieces on the floor.It's been a long time since I've loved a story so very much and I can't wait to hear more from Delia Owens.I'd recommend this book to absolutely everyone because it's too beautiful and luscious to be overlooked by a single one of us."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Social and romantic tale of seclusion ....,4.0,"Nature, grits, and love summarise this book, as the main character struggles with a never ending craving for something external including a partner, but finds more than enough satisfaction in her home and 'The Swamp'. Outdoors descriptions are unique and the analogies of nature to behaviour e.g. female fireflies change their lights to attract new mates, make up some interesting milestones of the book.Otherwise the book skates around social-political class systems, ideas of racism as the book centres around a murder and the classic 'who-dunnit' situations. Whilst the murder is almost never solved by way of cleverness, the unravelling of the main protagonist's feelings coincide in revealing clues to the case, physically and emotionally.Stunning cover and came speedily, as do all the other  NY Times bestsellers.Scenes of sexual nature and vulgar language are included as this Southern USA classic sits on the shelf with other contemporary classics, in the centre, where it can be nurtured into something more problematic for thinkers alike.Overall a shoe-in for themes of feminism, and challenging views on crimes and charges relating to gender dynamics, and convictions.Could have improved with more thought-out plot lines, and less repetitive days, and further development of the character known as Chase, who drives unwillingly to and fro, in his boat or car as the local fratboy on campus with no responsibilties ... however justice was served in this case ."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Very poor,1.0,"Can't rave about this book. I found the characters shallow, underdeveloped and inconsistent, the storyline contrived and quite ridiculous. The completely illiterate girl becomes a genius, the dreadful poetry we are meant to simper over which the ending reveals to have been her own ( ridiculous), the murder which quite frankly I couldn't have cared less who committed. Oh dear why do so many people rate it so highly?? The author would be better sticking to her expertise of flora and fauna and give up on the fiction."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Let the tears fall,5.0,"Loved this book from the first page to the last. Its power lies in the evocative portrayal of a little girl surviving, as Kya did, on the marshes despite her isolation. The author’s understanding of Nature is the rock on which this novel succeeds- like a creature in the wild Kya has to adapt to her surroundings alone and live off the produce of the sea and the marshes.The story propels you along, always wanting Kya to surmount the insurmountable - to find love, to be accepted. By giving and withdrawing love to her the story brings you into it- and you cannot escape until the end. I would love to have seen more live narrative towards the end - her life with Tate - but I cried ..."
Where the Crawdads Sing,The Marsh Girl is a good read.,4.0,A story of a girl in North Carolina who has been abandoned by pretty much all of her family. She's been called The Marsh Girl and tormented by many of the locals. But there are a few who give her a helping hand as a child and love her as their own.As the children of the town grow up they become more adulthood challenges for The Marsh Girl which results in a death and the Marsh Girl being blamed. The people who love her as a child and now a woman fight for her innocence.
Where the Crawdads Sing,A very unusual book,4.0,"I discovered after I had finished this book (I listened to it as an audio) that it is a real publishing phenomenon having been on the best seller list in the USA for ages. It is also being made into a film. I didn't know any of this beforehand but just went with it - it took me on a strange, atmospheric journey which I found totally absorbing. I think it is better to suspend your disbelief and just accept the somewhat implausible plot at face value.I loved all the descriptions of the natural world and this woman whose life we learn about from an abandoned 7 year old to her older age. She is very much ""bonded to her planet and its life in a way few people are"""
Where the Crawdads Sing,Isolated beauty and survival,5.0,"Such a sensitive, moving book. There are unbelievable elements to this story but that doesn’t detract from its whole. Imagining a young person living an isolated life on the edge of society, is particularly heart rending during the 2020 pandemic. Kya deals with her life by immersing herself in the bird life of the marshes and the sea. The author knows a great deal about natural science and it is woven beautifully throughout the pages while the brutality is not dwelt on. Love and loss are major themes. Kya’s creativity results in beautifully produced books - the reader can picture them clearly.An unexpected, and for me, a satisfying conclusion."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Pulls at your heartstrings,5.0,"Set in the 50’s and 60’s, this book has two parts to it, going back and forth between the main character, Kya’s past and present . One part is about Kya growing up deep in the marshes of Carolina, she’s abandoned by her parents and siblings at a young age, and left to fend for herself with mother nature as her guide. She’s shunned by society, after spending one day at school and is nicknamed ‘marsh girl’ by the people in her town. She lives a reclusive life, helped along by a kindhearted couple who are themselves separated from society due to racism, and befriended by a young boy, as interested in nature as she is and helps teach her how to read and write, eventually becoming a love interest. The other part is about solving the death of the town’s star footballer, who Kya has been rumoured to be involved with, she becomes the main suspect in the middle of the investigation and her motives questioned.This book was highly recommended by @reesesbookclub and it didn’t disappoint, I read it in a week and cried the whole way through. Kya’s character pulls at the heartstrings and you root for her throughout, as you follow her being left by her family, a small kid cooking and making ends meet by herself to a woman owning her narrative.This is a story of resilience, loneliness, what it is to be abandoned by your family and society, what someone can do against all the odds and the rare moments of kindness and hope that Kya experiences. I loved that it was set against the backdrop of a thriving natural ecosystem, with vivid descriptions of the wildlife that it almost becomes another character of the book, the joy and knowledge that she gets from it not only becomes her constant friend but is what teaches her to survive."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Almost a Five Star,4.0,"This book has some unquestionable strong points; the nature writing, sense of place in the swamps and along the coast and sense of time in the 1960s. The character of Kya is just about right - very introverted, self sufficient but with a moral compass as well - and the minor characters such as Jumpin, the sheriff and the two boys seem to have distinct voices.My main reservation is whether really such a young girl would be able to cope on her own for so long, then be able to learn to read and write and then write published text books. It doesn't seem likely to me.I think the books tails off at the end as well - there is no need to complete her life history post the trial."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Disappointed,2.0,"Started off well and after having abandoned several novels recently because of poor writing and plot I thought, at last a decent book! How wrong I was. The first part was good, but then it rapidly went downhill. The writing became heavily expositional, the central characters changing in an unrealistic way, the plot dragging and becoming unbelievable. I must admit, I stopped reading it and just read the end to find out what happened. Several things grated on me, how realistic is it for the son of a shrimp boat owner in small town NC to go to university and become leading research scientist? Why do the main character lose her local accent and dialect just because she reads text books? Her brother and Tate also lose theirs. I wanted to like this book. It was such a let down."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Writing style changed and spoiled it for me,3.0,"Started out brilliant: I found the writing to be enchanting and immersive. You really felt for the main character and could imagine her surroundings well. However, I found that this dackered off a half to two thirds into the book and was replaced with lengthy dialogue of the court room conversations, which spoiled it for me. Definitely took away from the 'magical realism' that was captured in the first half of the book.The ending, in my opinion, was obvious and I could have guessed it.I think if the author focused a full book in the style of writing found in the first half of this book, I would purchase her work again."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Absolute Rubbish,1.0,"Long drawn out , cliched and extremely unlikely. Passages of poetry dropped in at random. I gave up at 60 % as life is too short."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Good in places....,3.0,"This was a nice read, I wasn't sure I would enjoy it to begin with as it seemed a bit tame  but it got better. I liked the storyline development although some characters were a little unbelievable such as Tate never giving up on Kya or ever finding anyone else but it made for a heart warming read. The writing was a bit drawn out and over descriptive in places so I did find myself skimming quite a bit as not every object needs to be described in such detailI'd give it a a 3.5 out of 5 as where I read it and found it good in places there are many books I'd reccomend to someone before getting to this. I do think however they it will make a good film"

Where the Crawdads Sing,Simply spectacular,5.0,"When I read the first few pages, I thought this wasn’t a book I would enjoy but given the rave reviews it had received, I carried on. I’m so glad I did!It didn’t take long for me to be completely immersed in the world of the marsh. The author has a true talent for descriptive writing and I could almost smell the grass and the sea, could hear the likes of Big Red!There were moments were I felt real sorrow, true joy, and a few gasps along the way. I felt I knew the characters in depth and the ending was magnificent.I loved this book. It will stay with me for a long time."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Slow burn,5.0,"I had heard the hype about this book but the description did not draw me to it. It was chosen by our book club to read, so my hand was forced, so to speak.It is definitely a slow burner, but gradually I couldn’t get enough and became thoroughly engrossed. The use of eye dialect for certain characters helps to create an atmospheric ambience which enfolds the reader in the tale. The descriptive terms used are unusual which is captivating and brings a smile to my senses.I will not spoil this story for anyone by revealing the plot, except to say that I found it immensely satisfying!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Going to make a great movie !!!,4.0,"A lovely easy gentle read , which I enjoyed but of a stretch to believe a child of 6\7 could survive and I think it  would have been more real to make her 12\13 but  that aside the descriptions of the marsh were lovely and the story fast paced .Slightly to Kill a mocking bird copy car trial scene at the ending but without the depth ,but a good read  .I can see this being made into a movie and I bet there is a line of actresses begging their agents to get her the part of Kya as I write !!  It will make a great movie just make Kya  older when  is abandoned and you got yourself a blockbuster !"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Gorgeous read,5.0,"For some reason, when a book is ‘super’ popular, I postpone reading it.This is a perfect example. For me it’s like I had a delicious dinner, then had a super dessert. What a treat.I loved this book.Delia Owens not only uses the English language (albeit with an American accent) in a truly beautiful way, but she created a world so far removed from anything familiar to me.It would be impossible not to love Kya and care deeply about what happens to her.Thank you Delia Owens for transporting me out of the walls of my cocoon.Thoroughly recommend this book - as so many have before me."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Awful,1.0,What a disappointment. It started with the promise of something unique. An exploration of how a child might grow and develop alone and unsupported and who that child might become interwoven with a murder mystery. Unfortunately it quickly deteriorated into a cringy sentimental teenage chit lic novel. Some of the narrative was so appallingly bad it was painful to read. If it had been written by a thirteen year old girl it would be excusable but it wasn’t. The continuous punctuation of the dreadfulNarrative with even worse poetry just added insult to injury. How on earth has this become a best seller? I appreciate we all have different tastes but I simply cannot fathom how an adult could possibly rate this book as anything other than a weak and embarrassing example of a hackneyed genre.  I’ve never left a scathing review before but this was truly dire prose almost continuously from the moment the main character became truly alone. Shockingly bad. Don’t waste your time.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Loved it,5.0,"Loved this. It's a slow grower and I grew impatient with some of the lengthy descriptive passages, but gradually Owens pulled me in with her beautiful, honeyed writing style and when I finished I felt like I'd just returned from a holiday in North Carolina. The writing was so vivid I could almost smell the marshes and I learned a great deal about the flora and fauna - always good to learn new things from a book! The plot was OK, I guessed the twist, but ultimately the reason for the five stars is the creation of Kya, a compelling character who will live in my imagination for a long time."
Where the Crawdads Sing,First time fiction got lucky,3.0,"Others have detailed what's wrong with this book, and a good deal of it is the fault of the editor. For all it's faults, there is a quality of sincerity coming through.However far-fetched and implausible the plot, the author's sincerity kept me interested. However, for me, the poetry device didn't work. I ended up skipping the poems and I think the book would have been stronger without them. It's enough of an ask to believe that the swamp girl becomes a nationally recognized, published naturalist, but to have her quoting poetry by an unknown , who we learn at the end was actually herself, is a layer too far."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautiful nature writing,3.0,Delia Owens is an experienced nature writer and this is where I think the book excels - when she writes about the marsh landscape the novel comes alive. I found the crime story woven throughout unnecessary and some of the characters felt very cliched. Spoiler alert: I particularly found myself struggling with the way the sex scenes between the protagonist and her suitors were done. It felt exploitative without really acknowledging that. I wanted a woman more in control of her fate (without having to murder anyone). But overall a really interesting immersion in a place and time and a great imaginative feat.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautifully written and utterly addictive - one of my favourite books EVER!,5.0,"This is one of the BEST books I’ve read for a while, and it’s now firmly on my list of all time favourites! A heartbreaking tale of abandonment, survival, love, loss, longing, hope, desperation, cruelty, racism, justice, trust, human connections, desire... a truly mesmerising story that keeps you hooked from chapter to chapter. Beautifully written and incredibly clever - I absolutely love this book and I am in absolute awe of this author!-I highly recommend this incredible, beautiful, gripping, haunting book. If you haven’t read it - you need to!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Compelling reading,5.0,"As a fan of Liane Moriarty books and that Reeces Witherspoon went on to make Big Little Lies into a fab TV series, then hearing she had a book club online I saw this title. I downloaded a sample and was hooked. The book conjures up the most beautiful images of Marsh life and nature. Whilst reading it I imagined a film and lo and behold it looks like that might happen. Who would play the beautiful Kya... Ah my mind is wandering. Anyway, I'm thankful for kindle samples as I wouldn't have purchased this book without it. It is a beautifully written book from start to end. Am about to see what other books are on the book club list as this was such a different but compelling read for me."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Book of the Year,5.0,"This is the best book I have read this year. It includes everything important in a book. A continuous story so that you just want to know what happens next. In the beginning the young 6 year old Kia watches her mother walk away from the family home, this immediately puts you on her side as she goes through the traumas of childhood, adolescence and adulthood. The descriptions of the marsh means you really can understand the harsh living of the people. A book of love and relationships, nature and survival with a clever twist at the end. Warning do not be tempted to look at the ending before reading the book."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Powerful, moving, funny and beautiful! A MUST READ!",5.0,"I absolutely LOVED this book! Initially I was listening to the audio book, which was enchanting, encapsulating and had me hooked from the word go, but way the book is written is just so, so beautiful that I felt I needed the written word to fully appreciate it. I then ordered the paper back and have just finished it tonight.It is one of the best I have ever read!The way the author hides you through the emotions of Kya from young girl to misunderstood adult is a truly magical journey and I feel in love (or hate) with every single character!I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Devastatingly powerful,5.0,"Without a doubt a book that grabs your heart and imagination and pulls on it for over 350 pages. Delia Owens has created a life here that I was fully invested in and had me feeling every emotion possible. Never have I felt so invested in a book to the point where one minute I was nervous and the next I felt I could cry. Her writing style and descriptive writing needs no praise, it's phenomenal. You can visualise the world and almost feel the surrounding through her words. Absolutely outstanding. The second book of the year I'd give six stars if I could."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Couldn't Put it Down,5.0,"Seems like a lot of people couldn't get past the fact that a six year old girl was left alone and survived in a swamp; clearly they don't know anything about life in a lot of place in the US...the hollers of Eastern Kentucky, the bayous of Louisiana, the Appalachian Mountains and plenty of others.The author clearly knows her stuff when it comes to nature and habitat, and she wove those details into a spell-binding page turner that kept me enthralled.  I cried a few times during the trial; it was just too easy to imagine redneck sheriffs in a hick town railroading the girl who doesn't fit their mould.And that ending...I cheered.  Ask the people on the beach on Mykonos....everyone there heard me.This is a perfect summer read, do yourself a favour and grab it."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Brilliant- the writing is a joy!!,5.0,"I wasn’t sure if this was for me, but the reviews intrigued me.  The language, at first, felt alien but within a short while I was hooked. This is about a girl’s journey of survival in a desperately impoverished, virtually solitary, existence;  where the landscape and nature become her surrogate family. Her story is powerful.  As she learns about people and navigates her path I found it moving, disturbing, beautiful and thought provoking*. The writing is an absolute JOY.  I’m surprised this was the authors first work of fiction, as it is utterly brilliant. This book is one I will keep and reread many times; as well as buy again for others. I recommend it -without question. *Especially poignant as I read it during a period of global lockdown."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Brilliant. Forget the negative comments.,4.0,"I get the negative reviews. The plot does stretch credibility but it is fiction so we can allow the author her imagination. All I can say is that I loved every minute, couldn’t put it down, wept at the end and am still thinking about it. I think people who criticise fiction for not being realistic are rather missing the point. Fiction can be judged on many levels. The credibility of plot is one of many criteria."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Story,5.0,"I loved this book on so many levels. The author gave beautiful descriptions of the environment so you felt you were living there with the characters. My attention never waned as there are 2 narratives , the story of Kya and the possible murder of Chase, that are told without detracting from each other.  The attention to detail, which is some books can be burdensome. here only adds to the enjoyment. I particularly enjoyed the use of poetry as an illustrative practice. The best recommendation I give is I devoured this during the pandemic"
Where the Crawdads Sing,A beautiful story,4.0,"Having read some of the one and two star reviews of this book after I purchased it on a friend’s recommendation I considered giving it a miss, but I am so glad that I did not. It is extremely well written and the descriptions of all aspects of the Carolina marshes are quite magical. The story does take some suspension of belief as the Kya is very young when she is abandoned, and very fortunate to survive the vicissitudes of living in the wild for so long, hence my dropping a star. It is also true that the trial is based on the flimsiest of evidence but it is well done and as a lawyer I have seen worse. Having said that, I loved this book; it conjures the most wonderful atmosphere and a very well drawn central character as are the supporting cast! So, ignore the naysayers and immerse yourselves!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautifully written. It has become one of my favourite books.,5.0,"This is a captivating story - sad at times but also heart warming. It is beautifully written and the story has stayed with me. I wanted to keep reading but didn’t want to finish it. Evocative of the time and generation,  it is well written and compelling. The descriptions of the marshland and bird life were beautifully written. - you could hear and see the wildlife. I  had a real book hangover when I finished it. Grab a copy now."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Possibly spoilt by the hype.,3.0,"So, everyone was raving about this book. I was so looking forward to reading it, which can be a big mistake.It started off very slow and I wondered if not being American may have affected my enjoyment.I got to like Kya and was glad when the court case brought a bit of drama.What brought down my rating was one particular passage where Kya doubts herself and is somewhat self deprecating."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Simply beautiful. A book that lingers in your mind long after you finish it.,5.0,"Many avid readers recommended this book to me, (some claiming it was the most beautiful book they had ever read) and that was enough for me to read it; I didn't read the blurb, just made a start. Now that I've read it, I feel bereft. More bereft than I usually do after reading a book as I was completely captivated by the the marshlands, buzzing with life, intrigue and secrets.  I miss Kya & Tate, who were beautifully drawn. I feel more aware of and in tune with nature and language. The writing is skilful, well-crafted but economic; not a single word is wasted. It has the feel of a classic, with shades of To Kill a Mockingbird in the narrative perspective. A stunning debut novel from a truly talented and multi-faceted writer; I can't wait to see what Owens brings to the world next."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Mixed but really predictable,3.0,Why are people raving about this? It's a nice but pretty standard story. The last third of the book was utterly predictable and i forced myself through it. I enjoyed the discussions of the nature and the descriptions of the paintings and the authors deep love for both shines through. Her characters for the most part are just very cliché and we've met them a thousand times before. I can imagine it making a decent made for netflix movie. It ain't gonna win best screenplay for sure ...
Where the Crawdads Sing,It’s an unbelievable story so well written,5.0,A beautifully written book and although unbelievable it is after all a novel which I was engrossed in from beginning to end.  To imagine a little girl on her own fending for herself In the swamp was not possible but written in such a way I found everything plausible and stayed with her from the beginning to the end.  The poetry just added to the gentle way the writer took us through this story.  I loved every minute of it and would recommend it to every book club.  Take it and enjoy all the descriptive padding it gives.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Stunning debut,5.0,"A stunning debut by Delia Owens. This is a unique story that embeds a lonely, abandoned girl in the nature that surrounds her to the point where she follows the example of the insects when threatened. I found this book difficult to put down except, and this is my only gripe, when I had to resort to Google to understand words like grits. I still don't know what 'fubsy' means or 'toting his poke' In fact, I struggled with much of the dialogue. A glossary would have been amazing. Other than that this was an absolute pleasure to read."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Jaw dropping,5.0,"I read this book until late into the night. Every line is poetry. You are right there in the marsh with all the creatures hearingThem, seeing them, breaking your heart for the child who was so solitary and yet so loveable. I can’t believe this was a first novel. This woman is talented beyond measure. So many issues are covered here and addressed so compassionately and humanely. And in the end there is a twist, so unexpected it made me gasp. I wish I hadn’t read it so that I could read it again. Brilliant"
Where the Crawdads Sing,A spectacularly beautiful book,5.0,"I was not expecting to enjoy this book as much as I did. I was hooked from beginning to end. Kya was a wonderful character. She had the most difficult start in life and it beggars believe that a whole town could shun, spurn, humiliate and neglect such a young child. She succeeded against all the odds, but this wasn't a story about vengeance or retribution. Nor was it a sentimental, woe is me yarn. Instead, the author painted Kya, the lead character, as psychologically damaged, but strong and determined with an incredible connection and empathy with nature and the marshes. She became a creature of the marshes and this enabled her to rise above human emotions which should have overwhelmed her: envy, bitterness, loneliness, self-pity and anger. This allowed the story to take on a more positive path, but still with many struggles along the way and would be expected from a child brought up by nature and having minimal human adult guidance. A beautifully written book and a thoroughly enjoyable read which stays with you long after you have finished."
Where the Crawdads Sing,great distraction during a pandemic,5.0,"I really enjoyed this book, Owens has created a sympathetic character in Kya and put her in an unusual and interesting setting and I wanted to know her story and what became of her. I read it during the corona virus pandemic and it was great to lose myself into another world away from all the news and anxiety in a good page turning book. Couldn't put it down towards the end."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Suspension of disbelief required but still an engaging and engrossing read,4.0,"Despite some really rather scathing reviews, which made some salient points, this was a good old page turner with some subtle twists and turns that had me guessing until the (slightly sentimental) ending.Yes, some implausible scenarios, but let's face it, we don't always want total reality in fiction. I thought the book flowed well and I liked the emerging timelines. And, seemingly a rarity in the books I read these days, some actually likable characters for a change. Not at all surprised the rights have already been bought for a film."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Don’t believe the hype,1.0,I couldn’t wait to finish this book....boring beyond belief!  There is a “twist” but you don’t have to be Hercule Poirot to work it out - too obvious!  If you want to waist your time watch some paint dry instead.
Where the Crawdads Sing,A True Delight,5.0,"Absolutely loved this novel.It did find that initially it took a while to get in to, especially with the local sayings but as I hit the third chapter, I felt more at home.I didn't find myself getting bored at any stage and the evolving story definitely reeled me in.Your heart really went out to ""Kya"" and the way she was treated by not only her family but all the locals too. Heartbreaking.If this the first novel by Delia Owens, I'm already looking forward to more!!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Page Turner,5.0,"The writing is eloquent and the author draws you into the world of the central charcter(Kya). Each character in the book is believable and knitted beautifully into the story. Although it is not a thriller,  I kept turning pages, wanting to share in Kya's emotions and thoughts. The author's love of nature and poetry are obvious, again as a backdrop to the story but enriching it. i found myself laughing, despairing and being thoroughly engrossed and entertained. A must read!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Hauntingly Beautiful, Stays With You In Your Mind",5.0,"I read a lot of books and usually pass them on after reading unless they are reference books or specialist ones.'Where The Crawdads Sing' however will have honour on my bookcase forever. Hauntingly beautiful, well written and compelling - I cannot fault Delia Owen's novel at all. The settings are lushiously described while Kya & Tate are characters that you will fall easily in love with.I've been recommending this book to everyone I know, perfect Summer read.Read it for yourself - you won't regret it!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,A Brilliant Story,5.0,"""Where the Crawdads Sing"" is a wonderful story with great sadness and unhappiness but also joy it is wonderful at how the simple things in life can bring great happiness.  The birds, plants and shells which are a big part of this story for a little girl left deserted by her family.  There are some wonderful characters who show kindness and love to a lonely little girl  who  many others ridicule and see her as unworthy of their social lifeThis is a great book which will break your heart at times but make you laugh too.  I don't wish to spoil the story by writing about the contents this is for for you to explore and enjoy."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Wonderful,5.0,"I loved this book.  A slow enthralling meander through the wildlife of Kya’s loved marshes learning to love the landscape and it’s animal and bird life.  The mystery of a murder, or was it an accident?  A love story.  This book is all these things.  Underlying it all is Kya and her understanding of her environment, her place in it and it is where she draws her strength from.  Wonderfully written, gentle yet brimming with emotion and a true love of the natural world.  Just wonderful."
Where the Crawdads Sing,An oasis in a literary desert.,5.0,"I've been trying to find a great novel to read for years, they are so formulaic nowadays aren't they?This, however, immediately grabbed me with lovely, atmospheric prose from page 1.Fabulous main character, beautifully drawn, you do really get to know her. This book explores prejudice and poverty in an original way.I really enjoyed the setting, the cliche that the place is a character is explored really well here. I do recommend exploring North Carolina on Google Earth and looking at a bit of the history to give you a great visualisation, its quite easy to slip further into the  Cajun swamps in your imagination if you aren't careful, then you will miss out on an amazing setting."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Great story,5.0,"I’m late to the party here but I’m so glad I came! If you can assume that a child of ten can bring herself up in isolation in a swamp, the rest is a delight. With Kya’s background and experiences by then, I was prepared to believe it. It’s a great story, pulling your feelings from side to side as it progresses. There’s an excellent courtroom drama within the book and a murder that remains unsolved. I really thought the ending was fitting. A great story and one I’ll remember."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Where The Crawdads Sing,5.0,"I loved everything about this book; the gorgeous cover, the beautiful descriptions of the environment and of course the wonderful characters.  After being abandoned by her family members, Kya is left alone as a very young girl to survive in the harsh environment of the marsh land of North Carolina.  I completely fell in love with her, and with the author's writing style as she brought to life the flora and fauna of the marsh.  I'll admit, I did find it a bit slow to start, but once I got going I loved it."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Lame,1.0,Sentimental mush.  Enjoyed the 1 star reviews far more than the book!
Where the Crawdads Sing,Superb!!!,5.0,"I loved this book. It’s beautifully written, wonderfully descriptive and evocative. Part thriller it transports you to another world. Would make a superb film. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Excellent read to the very last page!,5.0,"I was recommended this book by a friend and was very grateful for this. It was a really marvellous experience to read.  The prose was beautiful, poignant, sad and inspirational. The in depth details and descriptions of nature and the conditions in the Marsh, as well as Kya's struggles, were written in a very sympathetic way, and really evoked visions of  the beauty of the Marshland, and the amazing creatures living in that protected land. A page turner, right to the end.  I would really recommend this book, it will not disappoint!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,A stunning read,5.0,"This was a rare and unique book.  Beautifully written, I became totally engrossed by Kya's pain and loneliness and her passion for the marshes.  The combination of the natural world described so vividly, her abandonment, shy discovery of love and the mystery of a crime for which she is accused was such a fascinating combination, and there were moments when I thought my heart could break.  An absolute must-read"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Couldn't put down this book,5.0,"This book paints pictures in your mind that will stay for a long time; beautifully crafted, with characters that live on each page and a vibrant backdrop that is full of knowledge and love yet doesn't make you want to visit since you know that what you will find there could never match the place so minutely described in this clever novel. In her first novel, Owens has woven a mystery that surprises yet makes complete sense and you know that it couldn't have happened any other way. I LOVED this book. More please, Delia."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautifully told and captivating from the first page,5.0,This book manages to inspire a wealth of emotions from the very first page. I felt fully immersed in the world of the swamp and wholly gripped by the court scenes. I couldn’t bring myself to put this novel down and found myself thinking about it when I had to tear myself away from reading it. It’s a wonderful story of courage and endurance and I highly recommend as a 5 star read. I have only just finished and  think I’ll read it again because I already miss it
Where the Crawdads Sing,One if the best books I have ever read,5.0,Delia Owens' command of the English language is unsurpassed and unique.  She weaves an exciting story around thoroughly believable characters and the result is a classically beautiful piece of literature which is an absolute pleasure to read.
Where the Crawdads Sing,You really do need to read this book.,5.0,"I didn't think I would like this story. I hovered putting it into my virtual shopping basket so many times, but the title kept drawing me back. Then a friend said the immortal words, ""Look! I'm reading this amazing book!"" It was the little nudge I needed.I admit it's an unusual book, you might start reading it & think, ""Oh no. I don't like this!"" But persevere, I promise it's worth it. I finished my copy a couple of weeks ago and am still thinking about it."
Where the Crawdads Sing,This is SO much more than a standard story about a poor girl's struggle,5.0,This came highly recommended by my two most reliable reader friends.  It didn't disappoint.  One of the books that you desperately try to slow down as you approach the end.  The landscape was superbly described and every one of the characters was believable and many of them lovable.  There weren't the stereotypes that so often occur in this type of novel. The twist at the end was as pleasing at it was surprising - I say no more in case you haven't read it.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Grits? Again?,2.0,"This novel has much to recommend it, but for me there were too many unnecessary authorial devices and flaws to make this a satisfying read. In particular, the abrasive and clumsy inclusions of poetry began to wear down my patience - whilst I accept this was (ultimately) relevant to the narrative, the cumbersome juxtapositions were just that, cumbersome. I found myself dreading the next page turn in case another poem was going to appear. And, whilst I am as a big a fan as anyone of the description of food in a narrative, it has to be relevant, spare and somehow add value - here, the seemingly endless listing of North Carolina cuisine just became repetitive and quickly lost relevance. Grits? Again? That said, the plot was well managed, the landscape made real and many of the characters were quite refreshing, even if some of the colloquial dialogue was a bit too ‘loud’ and again, clumsy, for my taste. I made it to the end of this novel but only just - the second half certainly lacked the sparkle of the first and the book overall fell short of it’s early promise."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautiful read. I love it.,5.0,"The story is set in a small town in North Carolina. In late 1969 when the 'golden boy' Chase Andrews was found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark because she is the 'different' one.Kya also known as the Marsh Girl has been abandoned by her family, one by one, since she was six years old. She lives alone in the marshes. This book tells the story of how Kya struggles to feed herself, how she makes money to buy essentials. She spends her days learning about nature. She has no one, until one day when Tate Walker came into her life.Tate spend most of his time with Kya. I loved the chemistry between two of them 💖. He teaches her how to read, share her passion for nature, exploring the marshes, cruising along the waterways. The description of the marsh are just brilliant. I felt as though I could smell the sea. One day Tate had to go away to pursue his studies and Kya was left alone again.The last quarter of the book was on Kya's court case. It goes back and forth between present day and days leading to the incident. Her story was heartbreaking but at the same time inspirational. It's a story of love and determination.This is a beautiful book which takes you on an emotional journey. Beautifully written story. I would really recommend this book."
Where the Crawdads Sing,I am so glad I wasn't put off!,5.0,"Just before I downloaded this novel, I read the latest 3 reviews that all proclaimed what ""ridiculous clap-trap"" it was.  I wondered if I should bother but thank goodness I ignored them and decided to try it for myself.  Where the Crawdads sing is a beautifully crafted story.  The marvellous descriptions of the marsh have a ring of truth about them so I wasn't surprised to discover that the author is a wildlife scientist.  I enjoyed following the twists and turns of such an original tale to its satisfying conclusion.  I know we are all different but do give this book a try - I don't think you will be disappointed."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Haunting and beautiful,5.0,This is a haunting and beautifully crafted novel that draws you in. The descriptions of the mash and it’s inhabitants is so evocative that you feel as though you are there. The story sweeps you along and you fall in love with the main character whilst never really knowing her. She flies away from you like and at the same time wrenches your heart in sympathy. This is a precious and amazing book and deserves to be read and reread. I highly recommend it.
Where the Crawdads Sing,A wonderful book I couldn't put down,5.0,"Although at first I found it difficult to get into in the end I couldn't put it down.The story of Kyra is heart wrenching.  It gives a good portrayal of life in the deep south and how prejudice still existed into the 1970s (and no doubt still exists).  Through her abandonment from her family to her first relationship with Tate. How she emerged into the most amazing author of all around her because she was not tainted by the outside world.  Tate betrayed her with the result that the alpha male Chase came on the scene totally duping her (as many do).  How she coped with her trial and lived her final years with Tate.  I liked the way the book did not stop when they came together.  Delia continued the story to the end of Kya's life not in great detail as this wasn't needed.  The bitter sweet discovery by Tate at the end, were we surprised, may be.Its one I will read again."
Where the Crawdads Sing,An excellent book,5.0,"This was one of the best books I have read for a while and I also bought it for friends who I know would enjoy the setting and story. The setting, in America is the wild swampy sea area  of N Carolina, beautiful and filled with wild life. The story is centred around a girl left by her parents and family to grow up alone in most difficult circumstances. But this brief outline does nothing  to show the power of the writing and how it becomes, truly , an addictive page turner."
Where the Crawdads Sing,So well written - a modern day classic,5.0,Loved this book - the author really paints the scene and leaves you feeling that you lived in the marshes with Kya. Original and imaginative. This competes with The Goldfinch for my number one book of all time. I read the 1 star rating given by a previous reviewer who said that it was unrealistic that a child could fend for themselves at such a young age - obviously led a very sheltered life - when you see young children picking through litter and living on the streets in various parts of the world!
Where the Crawdads Sing,A fantastic read,5.0,A beautiful yet heartbreaking story of a young girl Kya who's family left her alone and had to look after herself  She quickly learned how to survive whilst living in seclusion and she was known as the marsh girl and she spent her days in her boat and learning all about nature Such a lovely read and the characters are fabulous and written so sensitively by Delia Owen's and Kya's character will stay with you long after her story has been told
Where the Crawdads Sing,Incredible storytelling,5.0,"This story of a little girl, abandoned by almost everyone, in the most inhospitable of habitats, had me on an emotional roller coaster. More than just a tale of American history, it’s a murder mystery and a love story.I hesitated to read it because it looked and sounded like it was aimed at a female book club audience. Maybe it was. Maybe that shows how we try to limit our reading unnecessarily. In any case, I’m so glad I read it. I thought it was a brilliant story, brilliantly told."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Lovely story, sadly let down by implausible plot",2.0,"This is a beautiful, sensitively-written tale of a young girl’s life and loves in the swampland of the North Carolina coast. Tragic and yet heart-warming, I enjoyed every turn of the page: until the very end. The plot is fatally flawed, and I don’t think I have ever been so disappointed by a novel."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Captivating and beautiful,5.0,"A captivating and engrossing read... Kya is a young girl who finds herself fending for herself after her unreliable father leaves her alone in the swap lands of Carolina. Abandoned by her mother and siblings previously, she manoeuvres her way through life, forming heartwarming and touching relationships while keeping herself fed and educated. The separate stand followed the death of the local sports hero and this was beautifully done.  This was a story that kept me captivated throughout and I was willing Kya to succeed.  The intertwined timelines were wonderful and the ending tied everything up perfectly. I finished this book knowing that these characters would stay with me for a long time and it would be quite a while until I could immerse myself in another book."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautiful and heartbreaking escapism,5.0,"There are loads of reviews of this book on Amazon. most people loved this book, some hated it.  I will just say this, it's a work of fiction, if you can lose yourself in the imagination of somebody that obviously has a deep love of nature then give it a try.  I loved it."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Absolutely Outstandingly Amazing,5.0,"Well I don't think any words could ever quite  touch on how beautiful This book is. Outstanding i truly felt I was there in the swamp with Kya, the descriptions were beautiful. I have read hundreds and hundreds of books and this is only the second book that has made me cry. Felt quite emotional finishing it, read over 3 days i didn't want it to end i was fully lost . Wow"
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Lacks pace, rushed ending, irritating prose ..",2.0,This book was average.I wasn’t blown away as per the reviews.Yes - it was beautifully written but massively lacked pace.The ending was so disappointing and rushed. I found myself wishing the book away so I could read my next book on the bookshelf!The North Carolina “Language” was so irritating and disrupted the flow of the book.I was let down given the High reviews ....
Where the Crawdads Sing,Simply Beautiful,5.0,"This is a love story. Not between of two humans, or amongst humans.But between a girl and her land, her marsh land.When humans abandons, disappoints or breaks her heart (except one), nature never does.This is a story of young girl, left abandoned and had grew up alone in the marsh land.Kya Clarke was abandoned by each member of her family. They literally walked out of her life, before she even turned puberty, and left to fend for herself, alone in a shack in the marsh, with no human neighbours in sight. It is heartbreaking cruel to her and for her to learn abandonment at a very young age.As a young child, she had to depend on nature, by collecting mussels, oysters and smoked fish for sale for money to buy grocery. She was not welcomed by the villagers of Barkeley Cove because she was different, she was the “Marsh Girl”.Tate Walker was her saviour. He taught and guided her to be independent. Even though he loved her, he still thought she was too different for his world.The handsome, Chase Andrews, promised her the world. She was guarded after Tate, but perhaps she saw Chase as her chance to be more than the Marsh Girl.Her story of loneliness and having the Cooper’s Hawk, Big Red, birds, insects, crabs as her companions, was heartbreaking as it. Added to the fact, she was immediately prejudiced and deemed as guilty when Chase Andrew was found dead, she was alone and felt the world was against her, was sorrowful.The storyline may not be new. However, the storytelling is beautiful and heartbreaking. It tells you of the beauty of the marsh land, its inhabitants, the ecosystem and that nature is enough for you to survive - as it is always meant to be for us, humans. We just need to remember to treat it kindly.It seems apt to read this book (on Kindle) now. With lockdown happening around the world, Mother Earth is finally healing. We should be ashamed how we had taken her for granted all this while and we had forgotten to treat her well. May we become better towards her after this."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Definitely a book to savour.,5.0,"I absolutely loved this story and all the emotions it provoked. It ripped at my heart over and over again in this tale of a young girl, abandoned and left to fend for herself. Her journey to survive and live in a small opinionated town and her transition from young girl to young lady. Her first heartbreak at the hands of a man which made her retreat into herself over and over again with her seemingly only friends to be the marsh and wildlife around her."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Just wow,5.0,"This had everything I could ever want in a book I loved this so much. The heartache of Kay's abandment, the romance, the mystery and the beauty and scerets of the marsh.Normally I'm not a fan of poetry written into the books as I'd find them distracting from the story. However the poetry in this was beautiful well written and added to the story being told.So grateful I final took a chance and read this."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Overrated,1.0,Very good on natural history covering a wobbly pathetic plot.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Very enjoyable,5.0,"I enjoyed this book very much.  I loved the gentleness of the story, even though the main character had a hard life.  I could really visualise the surroundings as they were so well described.  I could feel for this child trying to deal with small town prejudices and her struggles just to survive, having been abandoned at a very young age.  I found myself rooting for her and wishing for her to find happiness.  Good twist too!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Love, death, abandonment and natural history",5.0,"The  images Delia conjures up are so vivid and clear that we are there with Kya every step of the way. It’s not often you get such a page turner of a story combined with the evocative descriptions of the Marsh and its inhabitants and its wildlife. The way the people and the environment interact, and how one has shaped the other Is described well. Her people are realistic, her Marsh is magical and the storyline is gripping."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Spectacular writing,5.0,"This is fantastic. What a book. I was gushing tears at the end. What wonderful language Delia Owens used throughout. I loved every moment of it. Her characters were so well formed, the story was superb. I felt a deep sense of foreboding throughout. Kya was such an endearing protagonist, her life could draw a tear from even the hardest of hearts. I really cannot commend this author and this book enough. It’s truly a five star read. I’ll never forget it."
Where the Crawdads Sing,how much grits can a girl eat?,4.0,Enjoyed this story as it transported you to a completely different time and place and liked the 'twist' at the end.  Some of the descriptions were a bit repetitive as was the constant need to tell us that Kya was eating 'grits' on a regular basis - we get it  - she's poor and lives on marshland!  Still a good story of how a girl is abandoned by all the people that should have loved and supported her in her life and how she tries to find a home.
Where the Crawdads Sing,A coming of age mystery,4.0,"I'm not a big fan of American novels (sorry), but this one I did enjoy. It's very visual. When all her family leave her, the girl, who is still a child learns how to fend for herself. She has been nicknamed the Marsh Girl (the marshes being where she lives) and avoided and laughed at by the towns people. Years pass. When the body of young man is found it isn't long before the Marsh Girl is in the picture for murder - the man being someone she had an association with. It's a good story and hard to put down."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Gorgeously written with an unforgettable heroine,5.0,My book club has been meeting monthly for about two years. This was the first book we have been able to agree on. It is wonderful. Beautifully written well drawn characters and improbable at the same time not wanting to end. Whenitispublishedin paperback i will be buying copies for friend not lucky enough to have read it..
Where the Crawdads Sing,Breathtaking,5.0,"I can’t get over how perfect this book is. Although I struggled to understand the way Kya & other characters spoke at first but as soon as I got used to it this book blew me away! The writing is utterly beautiful & I could picture every plant, bird, insect just as Kya drew them. Poor Kya was left to her own devices as her family leaves her. She has to learn how to live all alone apart from help from her friend Tate, who teaches her how to read. She does a fantastic job even with people calling her White Trash. The murder mystery was so well written, I had no idea how it would play out. I regret not picking up this book sooner. Absolutely beautiful & breathtaking! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
Where the Crawdads Sing,A welcome change of scene,5.0,"I enjoyed this book because it was located in such a very specific area, and the observations of flora fauna and birdlife  and sea-life were so detailed and important to the progress of the story.  There was a satisfying balance between harshness and gentle sympathy.  Often you had to remind yourself that Kya would have made the choices she did because of her less than kind experiences of other people.  There is a happy ever after end, but with quite a twist!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Absolutely Marvellous,5.0,"One of the best books I've ever read. Not one that I would normally have chosen but was hooked from the beginning. Beautifully written and the descriptive writing make you fall in love with a place you've never seen.  I adored the characters and whilst it's not a thriller, you can't stop reading as you have to know what happens next. Loved the ending, tearful, joyful and unexpected all at once.  This one will stay with me always."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Not great, not terrible",5.0,"I'm more shocked by the great divide of opinion here in the reviews, some waxing lyrical about how fabulous it is, others publishing it mercilessly.I enjoyed it, not perfect and many implausibitys but a nicely observed setting and a romantic idea. A few interesting twists and quite engaging. They can't all be Nobel prize candidates but this book is quite fun and candy floss but it does stir the emotions at time. Worth a read."
Where the Crawdads Sing,I didnt want it to end!,5.0,"Firstly,I am stunned by the 1 star critics that say they hated this book,because I loved it so much! It did what every great book should do it took me to another place and immersed me in the marsh. The poetic descriptions  of the varied flora and fauna was a delight and I was totally invested in the characters especially Kya.I really didnt want it to end and was sad when it did. Buy it,you will love it."
Where the Crawdads Sing,lovely read,5.0,"I found this book heart wrenching, without giving away too much this book for me is about how being different and underprivileged can be a trap that leads to profound loneliness, it's also about humanity and empathy.  I love how nature is weaved throughout the story and how Kya learns from what she lives.  If you're looking for a book with a different type of setting that you can be lost in this may be for you."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Exciting and Insightful,5.0,"So many friends had recommended this book that I finally succumbed. Wonderful descriptions of nature; poverty, man’s inhumanity to man, strength and weakness of character (sometimes in the same person), love in many guises plus a thriller - what more could you want? Some people questioned whether the heroine could have survived at such a young age but that was the only negative point I’ve heard expressed."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Excellent read,5.0,"After reading previous reviews I decided to buy this book for my kindle, so glad I bought it. After getting used to the author going back in time, I couldn't put the book down. It was almost as if you were there with the main character and felt so sorry for what she went through but as not to spoil the end, I am so glad I read it. Highly recommend this author and look forward to her writing another book."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Wonderful sense of place,4.0,"The novel takes you deep into the marshes and swamps of N Carolina in some beautifully atmospheric descriptions. The writer evokes small town America with all its prejudices and narrow- minded characters. Yes there are stereotypes, the kindly black man  from Coloured Town, the ace sporting star, the giggling spoilt girls but all serve to reinforce Kya’s strength of character. I enjoyed the nature and wildlife scenes very much.Less believable is the idea that a 6 yr old could survive in the way she did without someone apart from Jumpin looking out for her. I also found the dialogue irritating at times as the ‘marsh ugirl’ switched with apparent fluency from almost unintelligible dialect to Queen’s English. And the poetry, I confess to missing that out. It was awful and added nothing to the narrative.With more than a nod to ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ this is worth reading for the sense of place alone."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Not my style,2.0,"Read about 35% before giving up.  Enjoyed the beginning when Kya was learning how to survive alone.  Found some of the nature descriptions repetitive.  Once romance entered the story, I quickly became bored so skipped to the end to find out more about Chase’s murder.  Found the poetry awful.  This was a Book Club read and we rate our choices out of 10.  I am afraid this book will only earn a 2 from me."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Emotional, Heartwarming, Brilliant",5.0,"Just simply one of the most emotional books I've ever read, not in a chest beating,wailing way, but in a gradual feeling of calm and peace way, the atmosphere created in the words is amazing,even after I finished reading it, I cried! Kya, what an amazing woman, passionate, and yet peaceful, abused and yet untouched. Honestly, quite possibly THE best book I have Ever read. Delia Owens Thank you so much."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Have Bought For or Recommended It To Everyone I Know,5.0,"This is not the usual sort of book that I read but was told it was worth a look.  Beautifully written, very hard to put down and emotionally draining with twists and turns throughout.  Was very concerned the end would not live up to the rest of the novel but absolutely the right way to finish the story. Would definitely recommend this.  One of the few books I have retained to read again and one of the best of recent years."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Interesting to read about North Carolina.,3.0,A story of endurance but ( spoiler alert) I do not believe that she would have planned and murdered the guy  because she was so respectful towards living creatures.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Triumph over adversity,5.0,"Triumph over adversity, definitely. Six year old girl left by herself to survive in shack on marsh, how could it happen? Brings out the best and worst in people, makes one wonder how we would have reacted to Kya.Descriptions of wildlife, marsh and sea are wonderful. The description of Kya's book brings it to life.I would highly recommend this book, Involving, moving, intricate a joy to read."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Achingly gorgeous and hauntingly beautiful,5.0,"Oh my goodness.  Its been a long time since I've read a book so hauntingly beautiful and sad and as wondrous as this. Just a masterpiece.  Rich, evocative, achingly sincere and filled with such bravery and joy and loneliness and resilience.If you are looking for an intelligent and mesmerising read, this is recommended.I honestly don't understand all the poor reviews. This book is achingly gorgeous."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Pages missing,1.0,8 pages of chapters 33 and 34 completely missing
Where the Crawdads Sing,Gripping and intensely moving,5.0,"The author paints a vivid picture of life in the swamps, desperate loneliness and the strength of the human spirit. The storyline draws you in and although I guessed the ending, this is that very rare novel in which it doesn’t matter. I felt echoes of Tess of the D’Urbevilles as I was reading but Kaya finds a strength and determination to control her own fate  that Tess lacks. Well worth reading."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Thought provoking,5.0,This book was beautifully written and thought provoking... the author described everything in exquisite detail and used words and poems to make the scenery jump out of the book.. I second guessed myself a few times in trying to determine who the murderer could be or even if a murder had even taken place... a number of times it made me think about how our own actions and judgements towards someone may influence the way they turn out in the future and that not everyone is as they seem. The most important thing that shapes us is the way we react to what life throws at us and how we make use of the natural world around us... a really good read
Where the Crawdads Sing,Superb.,5.0,"I don't know how to adequately sum up how wonderful this book is but I'll try.The main character is complex and beautifully written, strange yet very easy to empathise with. Glorious description of landscapes, sharply observed other characters and a great plot, this book is poignant without being mawkish and more satisfying than a bowlful of grits.I hope this author writes namy, many more novels as this was a truly outstanding debut."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Absolutely delightful book.,5.0,This book is certainly a must for all book lovers. A wonderful story both happy and sad about a delightful person who came good despite fighting terrific odds. I was completely enraptured from start to finish and the ending was a big surprise. This book comes highly recommended as it was to me by a friend who also told me what a  great book it was. Have a box of tissues handy at the end.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Brilliant.,5.0,Occasionally you come across an exceptionally good book with a story that will stay with you perhaps forever. This book is one of those treasures. It is beautifully written and a joy to read. The importance of the environment and the wonders of nature are explored alongside themes including prejudice and loneliness . As the last page turns there is much for the reader to reflect upon.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Interesting but flawed novel,3.0,"For me, reading this novel was a mixed experience. I thought the descriptions of the marsh & the wildlife were beautiful. I dont think I've ever read a book where the landscape has played such a big part. I felt transported to North Carolina. However, unfortunately, in my opinion, the dialogue & the depictions of the characters did not in any way match the quality of the descriptions of the landscape. Cliched, overly sentimental & unbelievable. At times it felt like reading an old Mills and Boon corny romance novel. This started to annoy me more & more as the book progressed. I did enjoy this book overall, but for me it wasn't as good as many of the reviews are claiming."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Unusual mix of crime and nature,4.0,"This book has a very different premise in that a loner woman from the marsh lands fights against the small town prejudices of people who do not understand her, a fight which winds up in a murder trial. The natural setting and details of marsh life are excellent. I didn’t enjoy the poetry and at times the book is over written and verges into sentimentality. A good read for travelling."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Engaging, enjoyable & worth buying & keeping.",5.0,I was recommended this book & I am so glad I accepted the recommendation. It is beautifully written & is engaging in many levels. I enjoyed reading it rather than just rushing through to 'find out what happens'. I'm so glad I savoured it & I couldn't predict the finale. Thoroughly enjoyable & I'm sure it will be a modern classic. I have already bought a copy as a friend's birthday gift.
Where the Crawdads Sing,A chance to fall in love with beautiful writing,4.0,"Beautifully written. The prose is mesmerising and evocative. The landscape is as much the heroine of the story as Kya, in fact the two are irrevocably intertwined. I loved every word of this book, even if I found the story a little predictable, with the ending somewhat contrived. To be honest by that point I was so in love with the book it hardly mattered. I can not wait to see what this author does next."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Highly recommended,5.0,"What can I say a heartfelt read where each character gripped you with so many different emotions. You are truly drawn into Kaya's  life feeling her pain, loneliness and her love and respect for the nature surrounding her. You are taken through her journey as if it were you. I could not put this book down. Shedding a lot of tears along the way. The descriptive way this book was written you could picture every scene, I loved it."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A stunning piece of fiction,5.0,"This achingly beautiful portrayal of abandonment, loneliness and romantic disappointment, is so much more than a coming-of-age novel. It’s a portrayal of humankind’s inherent connectedness to nature, and of the resilience that happens when that connectedness is all that is left in a young girl’s life. But it’s also a realistic portrayal of human failing – of family breakdown, and of the societal rejection and cruelty that occurs against those people considered outsiders - especially when those outsiders are women. The poetic descriptions of nature interweave seamlessly with the plot to draw the reader in to the Marsh Girl’s world. I picked this book up idly, not expecting anything much, only to be knocked sideways by the way it drew me in. This is the most poignant and refreshingly unforgettable book I’ve read for many years."
Where the Crawdads Sing,THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BOOK I HAVE EVER READ!!!!!!!,5.0,"I'm 45 and in my lifetime as a bookworm, I've read a fair few books. Where The Crawdads Sing - is by far - the most beautiful book I have ever read. How Delia has depicted nature and the lead character's affinity and bond to and with it is astounding. So beautifully written that I had to put the book down sometimes to take a breath and take in the poetic prose she had written. Or the message she had conveyed. If you are a lover of nature and feel a bond with it then this is a book that will speak to you. P.s. Don't Google ANYTHING about this book whilst reading it! It will totally spoil it!!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Entertaining, but flawed, murder mystery",3.0,"It was atmospheric in its depiction of the landscape and wildlife of the marshes and overall I found it an enjoyable read.  But I found it too unrealistic.  Kya would have been found and attacked, or worse, I think as a lone child, I just was not convinced of that.  The romance with Tate was fine but why make him some kind of saint? And why particularly a childhood sweetheart?  Too sweetly romantic for me.  Bit too binary in terms of goodies and baddies as well.  However, the inclusion of poetry in the plot is interesting and the descriptions are vivid."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Would definitely recommend,5.0,"This is my favourite book of 2019 so far. A captivating story, beautifully written, which I think will stay with me for a while. A couple of times it brought me to tears, unexpectedly and suddenly, no gradual build up, just a sucker punch right in the emotions. Loved it."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Heartbreaking, makes you yearn for the freedom of the wilderness.",5.0,"I loved this book, 1 strong female character that has everything good in her life taken from her. Her strength of character is amazing, you find yourself seeking the peacefulness of her location. The sense of isolation is overbearing at times, yet she still finds wonder and comfort in nature. So decriptive you can almost feel the heat of the scorching sun on her skin, smell the swamp all through the seasons, hear the buzz of the flies and squawks of the birds."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Not quite the real deal...,3.0,"Starts well but then meanders through a rather cliched, overblown and ultimately disappointing second half of the book. The early scenes with Kya as a ""child in the wild"" are graphically described and quite emotionally engaging but the book becomes a romantic thriller which fails to deliver either a compelling romance or sufficiently potent thrills. The courtroom scenes are poorly realised, the prejudice & hatred that should pervade as the backdrop to the story, lack force - Harper Lee or even John Grisham it is not. The writing quality gradually degrades along with the plot and by th end it feels very rushed. The twist, when it comes, is not that twisty and I didn't really care."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Cautious 4 stars,4.0,"Well written and engaging. I found myself turning pages earnestly, and I loved the ecological beauty present in the story. I loved the themes of loneliness and isolation and the quiet exploration of trauma, the damage it does to us through generations.Structurally, though, I wish the story had been better staggered against the murder mystery, and as a wholly subjective preference I found the ending very predictable. I say subjective because it was emotionally satisfying and that will be plenty for many folks, but it wasn't much of a reveal. Side note, the POV did funny things (a strange kind of not quite omni) and that was a little jarring for me at first."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Persevere and you will be rewarded,3.0,"I would have given this book at least four stars if it wasn’t for the totally unbelievable first section that track Kya from such a young age, making the story line unbelievable.  However, from her teens it had sorted itself out and offered some beautifully descriptive writing ... you almost felt you were living in the marsh with her.  Really glad I read it ... very memorable."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Wonderful!,5.0,"What can I say about a book which kept me riveted from the very first page. Maybe my love of both biology and psychology , both sciences very evident in this book, are what made me give a very rare five stars. Sadly I think this is her only fiction book so I will not be able to find such superb fiction immediately but look out for this very special author in the future."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Oh my...,5.0,"Heart wrenching and beautiful.You feel like you are in the marshes with the heart-breakingly abandoned child, and share her wonder and love of all of nature that reveals itself to her.Can't see how the beauty of the prose will translate to film, but I can so easily see a version of this drifting elegantly, heart-achingly across our screens any time now."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A beautiful tearjerker,5.0,"A  haunting tale set in the  marshes of  North  Carolina, it features memorable characters, some likable, some you'll loathe. The heroine survives abuse and rises to triumph but the path is far from easy. Nor is the triumph what you think it's going to be. The prose is simple and though at times it's poetic, it never obscures the narrative. This book is one of a kind."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Best Book I have read in a long while.  Maggie Smith,5.0,A great story of abandonment and survival in one of the most inhospitable and prejudiced places in North Carolina.  I loved the writers descriptive writing which allowed me to see everything so vivid.  The characters were so real and I laughed and cried with the main protagonist Kya during her coming of age through to a murder trial.  A great twist is something that leaves you saying 'That was a great book'.  Maggie Smith.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Fantastic storytelling,5.0,"A breath of fresh air. A good story well told.* EditFor all the reviews saying this book is unrealistic as there's no way a six year old would be left to raise themselves. I would like to  remind people that there are still 6 year olds bringing themselves up today in third world countries. Back in the 1950's marshlands,where discrimination was rife, Kya in the story was one of these children."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Enthralling and beautifully written,5.0,"I read this book in a day, the writing is beautiful, excellent characterisation of Kya, who inhabits the marshland. Delia Owens transported me with her evocative descriptions. We follow Kya’s journey from abandonment as a young girl, her battle against the odds through to womanhood, against the backdrop of a murder investigation and the most beautiful landscape whilst drawing us into the ecology of Kya’s world. Throw in the love interests and this has all the ingredients of a future classic. Can not recommend highly enough."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Immersion in a marsh countryside,5.0,"This story was one of the  most delightful  reads I have experienced. The language was beautiful, the characters believable and sympathetic, and like many other reviewers I didn’t want it to finish. I read it too quickly for our book club, and it will one of the rare books I shall read again. I have visited North Carolina and the memories are very real in this book."
Where the Crawdads Sing,What a read.,4.0,"It took me a while to get into this book but once in Oh My Goodness.The writing is so beautiful and the protagonist Kya is wonderful. It was an emotional rollercoaster, just what you want in a good book.It is the kind of book that stays with you and I felt a little bereft once finished.I would recommend this to anyone wanting to be totally immersed into a storyline."
Where the Crawdads Sing,An American novel written by an expert naturalist,5.0,"I loved this book. The start is heart-breaking, when the young girl at the centre of the story is abandoned, but she lives on, in the most challenging circumstances. The way she is neglected by, almost invisible to, the sparse local population is horrifying and yet convincing. It is Nature that brings her solace and her own quick wittedness that takes her forward, day by day.Delia Owens knows the area well and her detailed descriptions bring North Carolina's marshes and swamps alive. Although I've never visited south-eastern USA, I almost feel I could paint you a picture of what I would have seen there in the 1960s.We get to know the various characters more through their actions and speech than by description. The longing for love and security felt by Kya is almost unbearable and is snatched away from her several times. At the end of the story, you need a good break before tackling another book.Reading Owens' prose, I kept wanting to jot down phrases and sentences but because I also wanted to know what was going to happen next, I never did! Everyone in my reading group gave it five stars."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Breathtaking, rich and consuming.",5.0,"This is the richest and most emotional book that I’ve ever read. I think I cried 10 plus times towards the end. I really can’t believe that this book has received anything below a 5 star review.This is author will clearly become a HUGE name is she carries on writing.Her style is beautiful and I loved the details in each persons accents. It immersed me into the book.The characters are extremely well developed and are all so unique.I was definitely connected to them and think my favourites we’re Kya, Tate and Jumpin’So happy a read this book. Stop thinking about it and just buy it!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Loved it, what a story.",5.0,"I know some have only given it 1 star but I can’t understand why, it’s a beautiful book. I couldn’t put it down. Maybe it’s because they can’t identify with loneliness and this book has it in droves, kya forced to grow up alone, become a woman on her own, defend herself, look out for number 1 and the little twist at the end. Well I loved it and it’s one of those books I’ll be reading again and again."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Excellent read!,4.0,"Read several very negative reviews before I decided to make my own judgement.I was glad that I did as I found it to be one of the best books that I have read for ages. Story superbly constructed, wildlife descriptions splendid and psychological examinations clearly explained. I wonder if the negativos read the correct book. Well written Delia - thank you!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Hard to fulfil the Hype.,3.0,"I quite enjoyed this book but given the hype surrounding it, I expected more from it. It is a very easy read but quite far-fetched and I found it ultimately disappointing."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Poetic, graceful, ethereal",5.0,"One of the best books I’ve read. I just love the poetic willowy feel of the book, the attention to the beauty of nature and the beauty of a girl unspoilt by the world. I love the twists and turns, the attention to prejudice in all its forms - subtle and overt. The unlikely friendships made and the path of love. I just adored it. Bought two for friends for Christmas."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Wow,5.0,"I heard amazing things about this book, and as is my nature, I was sceptical!I initially downloaded the sample and once I reached the end, I had to buy the book straight away. Within 48 hours I completed the book (which is an achievement being a busy mum of a large brood).I could not put this book down, I experienced a variety of emotions, I giggled in places and cried at others. This story is one of the best I have ever read....don’t wait any longer.....read the book!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Beautiful, a welcomed escape",4.0,"I used to think of myself as a bookworm but life seems to have taken over in recent years. Being stuck inside has made me read more and this has been the best book I’ve picked up.People are saying parts of this novel are unrealistic and suspending their disbelief was too hard. Yet isn’t it the stories so undoubtedly contrasting with our own experience of life that make us turn the page? Realism is a hard fact, harder right now then before. The soft escape with the Marsh Girl left me enchanted and I fell in love with her from the first page."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Crawdads don’t sing. They cry.,3.0,"Great storytelling about a child abandoned by her much-loved mother and all her family to fend for herself in the marshes of North Carolina. In the final analysis, despite its slow start and its overuse of poetry, it is a good read. The main protagonists are not my favourite characters.Jumpin’, Mabel and the courtroom cat, Sunday Justice, are. Crawdads don’t sing. They can if you want them to."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Highly Recommended,5.0,"Where the Crawdads Sing is a remarkable book. All of the characters are really well written, especially the main character Kya (AKA Marsh Girl). I loved the format of the book and the way 2 narratives are told until eventually they come together. If you’re a fan of murder mysteries this book is for you! Equally I found this book to be very peaceful and beautiful at times, especially when it came to Kya and her interest in the wildlife surrounding her!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,A superior potboiler,3.0,"This was a readable story but not the great book most of America seemed to think!  The plot is hugely implausible, the characters are often stereotypes and the writing is very variable ranging from the over-written to the downright sloppy.  Having said that, my reading group enjoyed the 'nature writing' aspect and found it light relief in hard times."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Memorably beautiful writing!,5.0,"This is a wonderful first novel which will live long in my memory. I fell in love with the character, Kia and rooted for her through her every disappointment and every success... The author brings such skill of insight and such truthful observation to not only her intimate knowledge of the landscape and its wildlife but crucially also to the inner landscape of the little abandoned child's thoughts and sensitive feelings. This is special... never a false note is struck... If you are a reader, don't miss this one!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,RARE BEAUTY,5.0,"I don’t write many reviews but I had to write one for this book. After reading many, many books throughout my life, this book is one that will stay with me. What a rare beauty this book is, every page fills you with the sounds, the smells, the setting, the characters. I was there with her, looking at nature as Kya was looking at it. I actually had a tear at one important point in the book, when you read it you will know which part I mean. Totally exquisite, would love to see this adapted on screen. Now I know why it has five stars, I feel a bit lost now I’ve finished it, I could of kept reading. Wonderful."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Wonderful Book but takes a while to get going,5.0,This is a very special and unusual bookBeautifully written and very descriptive.  I don't usually like too much description but for this book it is essential and explains many aspects of the main character.It takes at least 25% to get going with the main story line so don't be put off by the lack of action.  It all comes together and is worth the timeA book that shall stay with me a long time.  Highly recommend
Where the Crawdads Sing,Absolutely wonderful,5.0,"The most moving book I’ve ever read.  Very cleverly written.  The author's descriptions are so powerful throughout, one can visualise the people, the area, the home and its contents, the beaches, the boats, woodland, and most of all Kya as a young girl and when she’s older.  A handy box of tissues is a necessity but saying that it’s a beautiful story."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Unique,5.0,"Loved this book so much I was sad when I finished it! Really unusual and not at all mawkish; given the subject matter this could have been a temptation for the author and the book is much the better for her not falling into that trap. I really got a sense of place and time from the novel, once I had begun to understand that Carolinian drawl! Totally recommend this book."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Truly lovely,5.0,"This book has been recommended constantly by lots of people and features in plenty of Top 10 lists. .. this quite often puts me off books and I confess I've waited ages before picking it up.  However, it's a beautifully written story, rich in description & the feel of the area and its history. I really enjoyed the book and am definitely adding it to my 'will read again' list"
Where the Crawdads Sing,"I was hooked from the very first confident sentence ""Marsh is not swamp"" . By the end of this romantic love song to wilderness and nature you'll understand why. The puny girl Kya becomes a wily teenager and finally an independent adult. It's a fascinating study of human nature in adversity, peopled with kind and cruel characters. Great read.",5.0,"I was hooked from the first confident sentence ""Marsh is not swamp"". By the end of this romantic I've song to wilderness and nature you'll understand why. Puny Kya clings to hope as a child when one by one her supports leave. She grows older and more resourceful, but lonely and wary. Reliable love is tantalisingly just out of reach. Great story."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Such a moving tale,5.0,"I could not stop reading this, hour after hour, the desire to know more about Kya, to find out what would happen to her. The description of the marshes and the wildlife existing there took me to another place.I wept for her, I rejoiced with her and I forgave her.A perfect story, and, as this is only her first novel, I hope that there will be more to come."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Excellent storyline and amazing description,5.0,A brilliant story line with a very interesting themes including isolation and survival. Amazing images painted with incredible descriptions of the story's setting and interests of the main character. The biology themes were cleverly interwoven with each scene and images evoked by the writer. One of my favourite  books so far in our book club.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Brought out my maternal side,5.0,"Right from the very beginning I wanted to bring Kya home to love and care for her. It breaks my heart to know that this is a work of fiction but could so easily be a true story. This is a beautifully written book and I could visualise the settings, the sea, the boat, Jumpin's marina, I could smell the smells and hear the sounds. Brilliant."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Loved this so much,5.0,I loved this book.. It's beautiful and heartbreaking .  The wonderful walk in nature that the main characters take us on and the cruelty of most of the humans surrounding her. Jumpin and Mabel how real and human. I loved the characters so much. I was totally immersed in this and cried when characters were lost.  I think this will stay with me for a long while
Where the Crawdads Sing,So beautifully written you could visualise everything like you lived there with the characters!,5.0,"Am amazing book with so many twists and turns. It held me , and pushed me to predict what was going to happen and just when I thought I knew, it took off in another direction. Beautifully writen, with an underlying message on this day with a 'black lives matter'  movement active and a very clear message of karma. So many times being reminded - 'what goes round comes round'!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Incredibly moving,5.0,"This book was recommended to me by a friend. Not the sort of book I would normally read but I'm so glad I did.From the very start you feel the loneliness of this little girl, rejected by her community who survives the loss of her whole family and actually thrives. The author uses such beautiful language to describe her world and her feelings about her precious marsh.A beautifully crafted book, I would highly recommend it, and keep a box of tissues nearby!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Great page turner - definitely a must read,5.0,Having looked at the mixed reviews i decided to give this book a try. It was in no way slow or a disappointment.This book really introduces you to a different world of life in the swamps of Carolina.The story was captivating as we follow the life of Kyla the Marsh Girl and the reality of living in the 1960 and 70s.I would highly recommend this book.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Speechless.,5.0,"I heard alot of reviews about this book and thought why not. I wasn't disappointed this is set against two time lines but it was such an easy read. You are drawn in from the very beginning - as cliche as it is I really couldn't put this book down I needed to know what happens.The plot, the writing style and characters were brilliant."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Where the Crawdads Sing.,5.0,"What a hauntingly beautiful story.  Not enough superlatives to describe how much I loved this book.  Intense observation of human characteristics, and deep understanding of emotion.  Totally believable characters who let you experience, love, loneliness, fear, strength and joy.  It moved me in so many ways.  I really look forward to reading more by Delia Owen."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A page turning read,5.0,"I have not read a book for a long time that I enjoyed as much as this one.  I really wanted to get to the end to find out what happened.  Very well written and so very different.  I would thoroughly recommend this book, for a summer read or just bedtime reading.  The colours and wild life of the Marsh was brought to life on paper."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Excellent with a small but...,5.0,"It would be churlish to give this anything less than a 5 star review. It starts well. beautifully written and really takes you to the locale and into the character.Somewhere in the middle it shows signs of dropping into a chic-lit, but fairly quickly recovers. After the leisurely pace of almost the whole novel, the ending suddenly gobbles up the decades and all the loose ends become a bit too neat and tidy.A nice final twist."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A beautiful read,5.0,"I was initially put off this book as I tend to read the poor reviews first and I’m glad a friend recommended it to me. A lovely gentle, easy to read book with some poetry and magical descriptions of the marshes off the North Carolina coast and the wildlife that inhabits them. I felt I was there. An endearing heroine, a story of love and the lack of it, and a surprise ending. I was sorry to finish it and I know it will stay with me for a long time."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautiful and compelling,5.0,"This book pulls you in with great characters, vivid setting and a plot that meanders and gallops in all the right places. It’s a perfect book for lockdown - about Kya, the marsh girl - who grows up alone after first her mother,then her siblings and then her father leave her. Growing up she loves two men and when one ends up dead the finger of guilt points to her. Beautifully written with soothing and seductive prose that will transport you to another time and place and keep you guessing to the end."
Where the Crawdads Sing,GREAT READ,5.0,After seeing the amount of reviews I decided to get this on my kindle. Must admit it took a couple of chapters to get into but then with the story emerging i needed to read this daily to see what happens next.Refreshing read as totally different to what I would normally read. Loved this book and would recommend it.
Where the Crawdads Sing,I loved it!,5.0,"I LOVED this book. The writing is beautifully descriptive on the marshland and wildlife. But most importantly the characterisation is wonderful.  I loved Kya as if she were personal friend or family member. She is a strong, resilient woman and I'm going to miss her."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Brilliantly written,5.0,"Sad, heart rendering at times, the struggle and torment of the family is wonderfully written. The story of how a young Kya survives and is supported by the real people of her community is beautifully captured. The prejudices and segregation of her society has been written about with compassion for all those characters in the book."
Where the Crawdads Sing,An excellent recommednation,5.0,This was recommended by an American friend as a wonderful read.  I can only agree with her.  Such beautifully written descriptions of not only the marsh and of the town and its people but the use of language brought to life all the characters.  Loved this book and highly recommend it.
Where the Crawdads Sing,One of my favourite books,5.0,"The only sad thing i can say about this book is , now that i have read it, I wont have the experience of reading it for the first time again.  If this is a first novel for this author..... just wow.I have bought it for many friends and family and they all love it.... it has been two weeks since i read it and i am at a loss as to what to read next as it has raised the bar so high"
Where the Crawdads Sing,A truly wondrous book!,5.0,"I cannot recommend this book highly enough.  I do not think I have ever read anything like it - had me laughing, in tears and all the characters in the book are just, well wonderful.  Specially the lead character Kya...please buy it and read it and give it to friends....it was recommended to me by a friend in South Africa and I am soooooooo glad she did....leaves you wishing you could start it all over again...."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautiful,5.0,"I absolutely loved this book. The author's knowledge of the environment really comes through and as a biologist, environmentalist and all round nature lover, I genuinely really enjoyed reading this beautifully written book. If you're expecting a fast paced thriller/murder mystery, this is not the book for you. That is not why I read this book though - I read it for the nature aspect and can honestly say the descriptions of the marsh environment are incredible and make me want to live in the wild!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Brilliant page turner, couldn't put it down",5.0,"We chose this for our book club read and nobody didn't like it so that's a good reason to read it! I found it hard to put down, even though the main character has a very hard life you rely feel her inner strength to survive. Lots of themes running through the book from prejudice and poverty to domestic violence so we had lots to discuss in our group. Very good read glad we chose it."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A book that will stay with me for a very long time.,5.0,"I found this slow to get into, but ended up totally hooked. The descriptions are hauntingly beautiful and  the account of her early life heartbreakingly sad. Written in a matter of fact way though, so not dismal. A fascinating slice of a very different life to what most of us know. And what an ending. It is the sort of book one presses others to read so you can talk about it."
Where the Crawdads Sing,The author draws a picture of loneliness that is unsurpassed and shows the side of nature in the.onlookers in ways that we wish were not true  were not true,5.0,Reality erases the romantic notion that happy endings bring everyone together and the notion that a person so damaged could be miraculously transformed into the ‘norm’ of social graces would have belied who Kya had become - a beautiful normal human being reflecting the way life moulded her and her genuine heart.  The author reached into her own soul I’m sure in writing this novel
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Great story,full of atmosphere",5.0,"I loved this book , atmospheric. Well drawn characters . All set in an unforgiving landscape .albeit tempered with well  drawn pictures of wildlife. The main characters way of coping in  such circumstances is  so commendable and believable and the tension builds slowly during the course of the story.  Brilliantly done.I really enjoyed it!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Took my breath away,5.0,"What an incredible book - I stayed up late into the night to finish it. There is such a beautiful depth of knowledge of the landscape and ecology of the marshlands underpinning this fresh story and this lends the book such a vibrancy and authenticity. The story is original, tender, unsettling and very poignant. I would not hesitate to recommend this breathtaking book."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Excellent read,5.0,Fantastic story leading us from the life of a little girl through to womanhood .  Left by her mother and siblings to fend for herself.  The descriptions of the marsh the birds and animals transported me there. To imagine loving someone and they leave you too.Then to love someone who was not trustworthy was sad.  Great ending too.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Unlike anything I have read before...,5.0,"This is the story of a young girl who when abandoned by her family, survives. We follow her struggles to feed herself, buy essentials, learn to read, mature into womanhood and most of all to learn to trust other people when all she has ever know is people abandoning her.The writing is excellent and creates such a vivid picture of the marshes that you get completely drawn in."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Could not put this book down.,5.0,"I was gripped from the first page of this wonderful book - a murder mystery set in the marshlands of North Carolina, but the murder is more of a sub plot than the main story. A fractured family, a strange girl who the townspeople dislike for being ""other"" and living on the marshes. It explores prejudice, resilience, loyalty and the nature of true friendship.I couldn't wait for the ending, but at the same time, didn't want it to end.Highly recommended."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Best read for a long time,5.0,"Beautifully written, the story unfolds slowly and in delicious detail. The small details of Kya’s life are minutely and sensitively set out, but never become uninteresting. I really felt I wanted to know more about her as she became a heroine I deeply cared about. In the story, a catastrophe occurs and I cannot recall having felt so anxious about the outcome of a book for many years. Thoroughly recommended."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Oh My Goodness This is Incredible,5.0,"This book is absolutely amazing,the description takes you there into the swamp. It tells a child’s and woman’s struggle against prejudice of a community and her true love of her wonderful environment .It is impossible to realise what an absolute gem this book is until you get to the point when you can’t put it down.This is so much more than a great read, it’s a life changer excellent .Thank you Delia Owens"
Where the Crawdads Sing,LOVED it but a few reservations...,4.0,"Generally I loved this book and read it very quickly. There are mostly short chapters which suits me and the style of writing is very easy to get through. I loved that the story took you through Kya’s whole life and she is probably one of my favourite protagonists in a book ever. I loved her! There are plot holes which are highlighted in other reviews however if the author had included it all then the book would be about 3000 pages long! It’s a work of fiction! Anyway, I loved it the whole way through however unfortunately the ended devastated me. Not because it was badly written but because I had SOOOO many questions left unanswered and personally for me I like books to be tied up in a neat little bow. That being said, it wouldn’t put me off recommending it. Well worth the read I thoroughly enjoyed it (mostly)."
Where the Crawdads Sing,I loved every word,5.0,"I’ve never read anything quite like this. The setting was original and imaginatively created. I felt and breathed it. The central character was unusual but easy to identify with. It was interesting to read literature with a scientific bias.Descriptions were powerful, handling of language was delicate"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautifully written,5.0,"I had been looking forward to sitting down with this one for a couple of weeks, but I really couldn't get into it at first, I had a bad few days with self isolation madness (its officially a thing) and couldn't concentrate.  It probably took me 4 days to read the first 100 pages but after that I was gripped and wow.So beautifully written and with such amazing detail, the end had me in tears.  I am so glad I persevered, I nearly didn't as not all reviews are great, so stick with it if like me you found it slow going."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Breathtaking,5.0,"I can't remember the last time I read a book so captivating from start to finish.  Gently draws you in and completely immerses you into the world of Kya, the main character.  So vivid I actually cried at one point and couldn't read fast enough until I realised I was nearly at the end and then needed to read more slowly as I did not want it to end!  The only thing I felt a bit cheated by was the skimming over of the details at the end of the book when I wanted to know more but I just filled in the blanks myself and spent a long time after the book ended daydreaming about the possibilities.  I look forward to seeing this come to the screen."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A wonderful book,5.0,"Beautifully written this is an engaging story of a girl growing up in a remote part of America, ostracised and misunderstood by the local community, how she survives ,how she learns to love and is betrayed, and how she finally achieves recognition.  There is an intriguing mystery element as well which adds to the story.  A really good read."
Where the Crawdads Sing,The most beautifully written book in a long while.,5.0,"Immediately I fell in love with Kya and her affinity with nature ,  it was breath taking!  The story of rejection and survival was heart  breaking and inspiring. The support characters were apt and believable. I guessed the ending secret long before the end, Maya  was taught by nature .I will read it again and again!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,The crawdads sing loudly in this novel.,5.0,"Delia Owens wrote this lovely novel with a paint brush rather than a pen.  Her descriptive writing is so evocative that that when she describes Kya standing in the marsh, you feel the water splashing around your feet and the mud between your toes while hearing the sounds of the primeval seashore.This is a story of love discovered, lost and found again against a backdrop of solitude, unhappiness, rejection, and a passionate love of animals, plants and untamed nature.Recommended wholeheartedly to anyone with a glimmer of sentimentality in their hearts."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Heart rending!,5.0,I found this book a wee bit slow to start and almost gave up after the first chapter.  I almost wish I had.  A heartbreakingly sad tale that will play on my mind for a long time.  I can’t remember the last time I rooted so desperately for a character or when I felt so much gratitude towards a cat.  I’m looking forward to her next book.
Where the Crawdads Sing,If you are into this type of books you will like it,3.0,The overall subject is appealing though initially the book is written in a quite heavy english and a lot of southern dialects which if you are not familiar with makes it really hard to read.Somewhere in the middle of the book the overall story becomes so hard to believe that it spoils the reading pleasure. It is a fiction book but still should have a scent of probability to happen in life as is not a SF book. For me is the type of book that you do not buy you borrow from a friend.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Amazing and simply un-putdownable! If there is one book to read this year!,5.0,"Wow, what a page-turner from start to finish! I just couldn't put it down despite having purchased it during a holiday break in the UK. Love the author's writing style and the story-line"
Where the Crawdads Sing,A sweet rags to riches story,5.0,This book is a rare choice  for me because it wasn't for a book club. The characters were well developed and even the drunkard father became more tolerable once his war secret was shared. I thought the ending arrived abruptly. The final chapter could have been padded out. It's still a sweet and believable story.
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Nicely written, drawn out",3.0,"I felt the hype about this book wasn't justified.  I did enjoy it, more towards the end, as I found the beginning somewhat boring, it is well written, no doubt but not a book I couldn't put down. Nice twist in the end, could have done without all the poems and a little more suspense."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A very beautiful book...,5.0,"Beautifully written, a great story very well told. In fact, when I got to the last third I read solidly for five hours as I had to know the end.A great first novel very descriptively written that I could see, hear and smell the marsh and Kya's surroundings.A great first novel, I hope she writes more."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Marvellous saga!,5.0,"I normally steer clear of American fiction, but this was drawn to my attention by a former relative. What a surprise indeed! This ranks as a superb piece of fiction, beautifully set out. I feel as though as I was there, on the marshes with Kay and Tate. It did seem rather obvious that Kay had killed the odious Chase, but never mind. I have experienced a wonderful story."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Brilliant book!,5.0,"Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Beautifully written, wonderful descriptions, characters you can empathise with (not that I have ever lived on a swamp!) and a very good pace to the story. A page turner in that you wanted to know what happened next but also one that you didn't want to end as you were so engrossed in the place and time."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Loved this book, brought me through 10 emotions in a day",5.0,"The ending of this book was difficult to read as I had to keep on wiping the tears away.  It was a book full of melancholy, euphoria, learning, eagerness, youth, faith....  I could go on,  it was really a terrific read that brought me through each of the emotions with the growing up of Kya and all that she learns along the way.  It highlights the cruelty of people but also the kindness of others."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A joy to read,5.0,This book is beautifully written and you are easily transported into Kya's mesmerizing yet brutal world. I was left cheering for the underdog through the twists and turns. Kya and her life are reminiscent of a Disney film. Read it in a few days as I couldn't put it down. Thoroughly recommend this book.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Couldn't put it down,5.0,I read this book as it had been recommended by several people. And justly so.I started reading it and the only reason I put it down was because I was in the middle of decorating! I made tea with it in one hand.The characters and the descriptions have you there. No spoilers.  Just read it.
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Unusual theme, gripping story",5.0,"This is an amazing book with a denouement that you may not see coming.  Beautifully & thoughtfully written, the heroine is an unusual child with a 'different' lifestyle who grows up into an unusual woman taking advantage of the 'strangeness' of her environs. A brilliant read that stays in the mind for a long time."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Excellent book. I strongly recommend it,5.0,Brilliant book. I wasn’t sure about the subject matter when I read the back cover of the book. However it was fantastic and I really felt I knew the lead character so well. I couldn’t wait to read another section and was sad when it all ended. The descriptions of the scenery were excellent. The only negative is that the ending with a lot of intervening years seemed very rushed But that is a small thing.
Where the Crawdads Sing,A must read!,5.0,"I only started reading this book as it came up as a popular read on Amazon. I downloaded the sample and didn't expect to be drawn in and captivated by this marvellous storytelling.  I can honestly say I have never read anything like it. The way the author weaves a tale of the beauty of nature with murder and abandonment is remarkable. Although there is brutality in the narrative, the author has somehow managed to preserve the beauty and joy of nature. The characters evoke empathy and emotion whilst retaining depth and intrigue. Fabulous book that I thourghly enjoyed reading and couldn't put down. Look forward to reading more by this author."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautifully written book,5.0,"This book is not one I would pick up usually, but our book club decided to have it. Once I started it I was hooked. A death, a life, interlinked by the natural surroundings and circumstances.  A lead character so well drawn that I was sucked into her world right from the start. The prose is beautifully crafted, and very moving in parts, and an end that takes your breath away. Cann't recommend it highly enough."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Fantastic best read for ages,5.0,I could not put this book down. It has been years since I read something this good. I still keep thinking about it. I appreciate the way it is written and enjoy the way the author has described the surroundings. Not only did I feel like I really knew the marsh I felt I knew all the characters by the end. Thank you
Where the Crawdads Sing,Wonderful rich setting for a beautifully told story,5.0,An unusual story with a very particular setting by a writer who is obviously very knowledgeable about this environment and has a great affinity to it too. Although it gets off to a slow start I was very soon hooked and remained so until the final page. One to savour.
Where the Crawdads Sing,The marsh girls tale,5.0,A beautiful story written with love and sadness - wonderful descriptions of a young girls haunting struggles against nature and society. The descriptions are compelling and the end is as it should be.  Chases death is a relief and the way he died a measure of justice for the horrors he inflicted on his victim!!
Where the Crawdads Sing,Loved loved loved it!,5.0,"Reviewers seem very divided on this book.  I had no idea what to expect as I didn't read the reviews beforehand.  It therefore took me by surprise and I fell in love with its gentle tone and the sway of the Marsh.  I was rooting for Kya throughout, and had my heart in mouth at the trial.  I could visualise the characters and felt I got to know them, which is the heart of a good work of fiction for me.I hope the film does the stunning descriptive powers of nature in this book justice."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Great read including interesting characters. Left me wanting more!,5.0,"There’s was nothing about this book that I disliked. I loved this book and will definitely read it again at some point. I loved the characters, I liked how discrimination was quietly but clearly acknowledged within the book and for the first time I was ok with the main character leaving things unsaid. Wonderfully written, easy to read, great references to nature. Left me wanting more."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautiful and lush,5.0,"I always feel dubious of books that are so strongly recommended and reviewed by all. Crawdads is a book of beauty, stillness and all at one with nature; a girl abandoned by her family and grows up separate from the human world and at one with nature.  It is very well written and the words flow and are luscious slow and meandering like the area where Kya lives (almost remind me of Porgy &Bess)  Read with a southern accent in your head for maximum effect but most importantly read and enjoy"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Wonderful story!,5.0,"This is one of those books that you start reading slowly half way through because you don’t want it to end! Yes, of course there are certain aspects which are not wholly believable, but this is fiction. Suspend your disbelief and get lost in this beautifully written and engaging story."
Where the Crawdads Sing,incredible read,5.0,"The details and knowledge and research that has gone into this story is so impressive. I read it in 4 nights could not put it down . A really enjoyable tale with twist and turns , it really put you through lots of emotions , as you go through the book. A book to definitely recommend , and to read again."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Have recommended to friends.,5.0,"I can understand some other readers comments that the story is too unbelievable for them however I think a certain degree of imagination if required. It's not necessarily a true to life story but rather more of a fantasy. If you don't get too hung up on the smaller insignificant details (how could a young child survive in a swap on her own and not get sick and no one helps her out etc) then the book is a beautifully descriptive story and immerses the reader in a world of 1950s north carolina swamp marshes, coming of age in isolation and love and loss. The story was not as predictable as I thought it would be (I had an idea in my mind of how I thought it would end). A far as escapism goes, it's a good read."
Where the Crawdads Sing,My favourite book of the year (after reading a lot!),5.0,"I read this early in 2020 and have read lots of books since due to lockdown. Along with American Dirt it’s the most memorable book of the year and my overall favourite. If you like it you will probably like Crow Lake (Mary Lawson) which I’ve just finished and is a similarly lovely story with interesting, likeable characters that feel real."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A story to feed your soul !,5.0,Loved this . If you want something different to read I thoroughly recommend the tale of Kya the marsh girl. Beautifully written and absorbing its a totally different world that she inhabits but not in any futuristic or science fiction way so don’t be put off. It’s about her life from beginning to an end that leaves you breathless. You won’t be disappointed
Where the Crawdads Sing,Inspiring thought provoking novel,5.0,"Thank you Delia Owens for writing this book. It was thought provoking and engaging. When the Crawdads Sing has been on my tbr for a while and now that I'm finished it I'm really pleased I have read it but desolate that I have read it. I found this book thought provoking and different. Delia Owens portrays Kyas world in such wonderful detail, I will never look at a bird feather in the same way. I wish I had this book to read for the first time and would wholeheartedly recommend it😊"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Wonderful,5.0,Unique story that pulls you in and makes you worry for the main character while admiring her at the same time. Plot moves along nicely and the descriptions paint an evocative scene. Loved it. Sad to see it end!
Where the Crawdads Sing,Kept my interest to the very end.,4.0,"This book was chosen by the reading go up I am part of. I must admit I wasn't sure  I would be interested,  but I was pleasantly surprised.  Really enjoyed the descriptions of the wild marsh and all it's inhabitants. Felt l got to know the character's really well. Very enjoyable ."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Wonderful storytelling, beautifully written.",5.0,"I am not usually interested in long descriptions, but the descriptive writing in this book is wonderful; it takes the reader right into the town, swamp and into Kya’s life. The reader identifies with Kya’s emotions, and all the characters are beautifully drawn. By far the best book I have read in a long time."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautiful read,5.0,I am loving this book. We are reading it for book club. It is beautifully written- so descriptive. The story is intriguing and while the start is sad the strength and resilience of the heroine is remarkable. We will have plenty to discuss. Loving learning about the marshlands too
Where the Crawdads Sing,A beautifully written compelling read.,5.0,"This book not only drew the reader in, with its twists and turns of the plot, but it also contained the most evocative descriptions of the nature of marshlands.  The detailed descriptions of the natural landscapes brought to life the flora and fauna of the marsh.  Thus the story flowed seamlessly along and was given an enhanced depth due to the backdrop depiction of the marsh, this aspect was a delight.  Moreover, the book was an undeniable page turner, difficult to put down.  I was really sorry to have finished it."
Where the Crawdads Sing,One sitting!,5.0,"Tried my best to read this in one sitting but failed as I needed sleep. It’s been a long time since writing of this quality has enthralled me. The author has written about a very unfamiliar landscape to me and brought it alive. Wonderful main character, heart wrenching and beautiful all at once. No wonder this is a best seller."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Fab read,5.0,This is a great novel and one that you can’t put down. It is beautifully written and when I read it I was transported to wherever the author wanted me to be. Loved it!
Where the Crawdads Sing,Simply Brilliant!!,5.0,OMG ....what can I say about this book that hasn't been said before. The story of a young girl who has been abandoned by everyone she has ever known or loved and how others perceive her. This is one of those books that will stay in my heart and head for a very long time. Everyone should read it....but be ready with the tissues
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Enthralling, moving story of rejection, loneliness and the redemptive power of nature",5.0,"I loved this beautiful novel which had such an original storyline.  It is full of amazing descriptions of nature, some of them written as poetry - the marshland is such an atmospheric background to this story of abandonment, rejection and loneliness.  The author's love of birdlife and nature runs through every page.  The story of Kya is engrossing and heartbreaking in parts.  The unexplained death and subsequent murder enquiry adds a thrilling, foreboding element to the book making it almost impossible to put down."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Rather disappointing.,3.0,"I’m not a great whodunnit fan but was initially engaged by the plot, until I began to wonder what audience the novel was aimed at: children abandoned by their parents is a ploy used from Dickens to Rowling. The love interest was starkly contrasted and as the final pages turned the resolution did not come as a great surprise."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A wonderful book,5.0,I was captivated by this story from the first page. Seeing the strange and otherworldly swampland through the eyes of a child made it seem very real. The strong character of Kya was so well drawn that I could believe she survived alone to adulthood . I lived through every hardship with her and shared the beauty of the birds and landscape she loved.The last few chapters were nail biting and the final unveiling of the truth was completely unexpected.I found it reminiscent in parts of Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Brilliantly written,5.0,"This story transported me to unknown territory, but by the end of the book it was familiar and comforting. Carefully drawn characters , each one individual and unique, telling the most original murder mystery one could wish for.I would wholeheartedly recommend this book."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Out on the marsh,5.0,A really lovely story about a girl abandoned to a lonely life on the marsh. Her development and how she overcame everything to be a well known author of marsh life. A bit of a whodunit as well.  The story hooks you in and let's you live with Kya in her habitat.  Excellent.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautiful writting,5.0,"Not only does this novel grip both the heart and the mind with a well crafted story addressing many topics , including a murder investigation.It's is so beautifully written, with just the right amount of fine detail.If recommend this fascinating book every time"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Atmospheric and beautiful. A great debut novel.,5.0,This book drew me in after the first few initial pages. Quite detailed in it's description of the marsh land and habitat it is almost like a non-fiction book to start with but then the story unfolds. I like the fact that it is quite slow paced and full of atmospheric description of a place I have never visited. I really liked and admired the main character.  A book that stays with you long after you have finished the last page.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Excellent read!,5.0,This was a really good story and kept me hooked.  The ending has a great and unexpected twist (though it’s not a thriller!).  I see it’s in the fiction charts in my latest Saturday Times Culture and Review supplement - well deserved in my opinion.  Buy it for an unusual story!
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Stunning Story, Beautifully Written",5.0,"A stunning tale about Nature, natural and human, and how they inextricably weave together. It is a beautifully and evocatively written bittersweet tale that will live with me for a very long time. This is a near-perfect novel, and quite the best have read in a very long time. I can not recommend it highly enough."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Couldn't put it down,4.0,"It was a bit of a slow burner but once I got into it, I couldn't put this book down. I think some of the reviews here are too harsh. The author takes you into another world, one that really connects you with nature and does so with such detailed knowledge you can picture it all so clearly. I felt really drawn to kya and loved seeing her journey and blossom through her hardships, along with the help of some lovely characters and acts of real kindness."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A must read.,5.0,When I finally had the chance to pick this book up to read I couldn't put it downThe author has such talent in describing every detail of the marsh so much so I could almost smell the damp moss and mud.The story is compelling and I can't wait to see what more this author will produce.
Where the Crawdads Sing,A wonderful first novel.,5.0,A gripping tale of swamp life and a girl who rises above her circumstances - given the added impetus of being a detective story which brings out the prejudice and snobbery of life in the Louisiana swamp lands. I enjoyed the book enormously and believe that as a first novel it promises great things for the future. Strongly recommended.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Absoloutly brilliant,5.0,"I loved all of this book. The story of abandonment and resilience, along with some love, hate, despair and nature. I loved the way the nature of insects, plants, birds and everything was matched with human behaviour. The ending was a bit of a surprise in some ways but felt right."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A great read.,5.0,"A very moving story of a young girl's abandonment by her family and her survival.  Despite being mocked and shunned by most of the local community, a few people help her survive into adulthood in the natural world of the marshes where was born.  The detailed descriptions of nature and it's cycles and how she interacted with them were fascinating. The characters were well drawn and I felt I really knew them by the end. The many difficulties and loneliness she faced were balanced with some years of happiness later in her life. The  twist at the end was quite unexpected."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Pish,1.0,"I’m not sure why I ended up buying this novel. Perhaps because it was a Sunday Times best seller. Alas, I was duped. It’s pish. Mills and Boone for the middle class. It’s literature,  it not as we know it. Shakespeare will turn in his grave."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Implausible story line but page turning,5.0,"Firstly I loved the book, such beautifully drawn characters and I have been to North Carolina and kayaked along the rivers  so totally could imagine the scene - but it was almost implausible to believe a young child could survive alone in the swamps - but hey ho it is a story. The tender help of the fabulous Jumpin' and his wife - brought tears to my eyes."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Wonderful,5.0,"I bought this book ages ago as a Kindle Daily Deal but never actually got round to reading it. During this heatwave, sitting on the deck of our narrowboat, I have devoured it, have found myself totally immersed to the point nothing else got done. Honestly if you only read one book this year, make it this one."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Short on plot,2.0,More of a nature book than a novel.  Beautiful descriptions of the marsh but very little plot.  One of those books where I am clearly in tne minority who didn't love It.
Where the Crawdads Sing,A wonderful book,5.0,"The first thing about this book that caught my eye was the title. It spoke to me because as a child I had been born in South Carolina and crawdads were where everywhere. As I began to read this wonderful novel, memories of my childhood flooded back to me. I did not live the life of Kay’s but it surrounded me as a child. Moving on from that, I became enchanted with the main character,her gentleness, her courage, her resilience and fortitude. I won’t give away the plot, but will tell you that I could not put it down. One of the best books I have read in a long time."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Wonderful,5.0,"This was a choice for my local book club, not a book I would normally choose to read but so glad I did. Against all odds a child survives by herself, finds a friend who helps her in many ways. Quite a few twists along the way, not a book to easily put down. Please read, you won't regret it."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A truly original read,5.0,"I loved this book and read it in record time as I just couldn't put it down.  It is exquisitely written and gives a wonderful picture of the North Carolina marshes and their wildlife, and that's apart from the human element, which in itself is completely compelling and beautiful.  I cried as I finally finished reading it.  A real must read."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Great page turner,5.0,"I loved this book and I can't really describe why!  It was such a change of pace from many of the thrillers I've read recently, but it totally captivated me.  The setting in the swamp was so vividly described and Kya was so brave and resourceful, I just wanted to keep reading to make sure that she would stay safe in her very unconventional world. It's a great story and I highly recommend it!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,A masterpiece in depicting the cruelty of exclusion and the beauty of perseverance.,5.0,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The title put me off at first as I didn’t know what a ‘crawdad’ was. It was an easy read that I found hard to put down and when I did, I couldn’t wait to get back to it. Although I have no personal experience of the setting, I felt as if I was there in the marshes. Beautifully written! I definitely recommend it."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Great book,4.0,"I'd never read this author before but was engrossed in this story before many pages were turned.  It was so original, so completely different from anything I've read before I found myself having great difficulty closing it. Will look for other stories by this writer."
Where the Crawdads Sing,I only keep books I know I'll read again ...,5.0,"I first read this brilliant book on my phone (in 2 days thanks to the world being in lockdown). As I know I'll want to re read it I've just ordered an actual book for my forever book shelf. I loved every page and cried at the end, not just for the wonderful characters and a story I never wanted to end, but because I had literally finished the book. Delia Owens please write some more novels soon. And finally, thank you for a brief magical escape into the marshlands with Kya."
Where the Crawdads Sing,One of the best books I’ve ever read,5.0,"I just loved this book from beginning to end. The description of life on the marshes,  Kya’s difficult existence there but also the beauty of her discoveries, the love story, the intrigue are all interwoven into this beautiful story. Just so sad I’ve finished it. A tale that will stay with me forever."
Where the Crawdads Sing,superb,5.0,"probably one of the best novels I have read in recent years. A gripping storyline and plot, finely drawn characters.  Intriguing descriptions of natural habitats, addressing prejudices and attitudes relevant to today.I won't forget it for a long time and recommend you give it a try!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,An instant classic,5.0,"I loved every part of this book. From the poetic style of writing, the magical way it takes you right into the marsh lands and the heart breaking raw story.  It will have you in tears but you will forgive the author because she ultimately took you to another world that is oh so beautiful.  My favourite book of all time."
Where the Crawdads Sing,I could not put this down!,5.0,"I absolutely loved this book. Beautifully written, it made me fall in love with the marsh landscape in which it is set. I found it more of a page turner than anything I have read for a long time, with mystery and twists right up to The end. The only thing that annoyed me slightly about it was the rather clichéd descriptions of the predictably beautiful protagonist. Not, however, annoying enough to lose a star over! The images conjured up by this book will stay with me a long time. I can't wait for Delia Owens' next novel."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Now what will I do?,5.0,"Read this book during the Covid lockdown.  It is such a good book.  The descriptions of the marsh and the wildlife are so evocative and real.  I love books which are strongly anchored in place.  Plus a moving story that said much about isolation, struggle and how people are easily regarded as bring ‘other’.  Highly recommended!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,A fabulous read!,5.0,"Lots of books are excellent but every now and then an exceptional book comes along.  Where the Crawdads Sing is one of these. Very well written, wonderfully descriptive, heartbreaking and keeps you hooked.  I am nearing its conclusion as I write this -  I am looking forward to seeing how it ends but at the same time wish it would carry on."
Where the Crawdads Sing,It will be an enduring favourite book,5.0,"This wonderful book seems to have everything- well drawn characters, splendid descriptions of a very unique area,  exploration of loneliness, prejudice, survival and very importantly suspense.  It’s the sort of book you can’t possibly skim read, every word is vital.  I loved it."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Tenderly expressed tense and harsh story a life supported by nature and love.,5.0,"Beautifully written story of a resilient forlorn abandoned but resilient child, who grows to discover her love and passion for the nature around her and how that helps her understand her community and herself. Tense up until the last page, with an ending I hoped for."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A-MAZ-ING,5.0,"This is a beautiful novel.I found it a little difficult to get into but, oh wow! Once I did...The characters are so drawn so deeply. The story is intriguing until it becomes agonising.I love this book. It’s a modern classic."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautiful,5.0,"I haven't finished a book in so long but this blew me away and I couldn't put it down. As a lover of nature, it drew me in, and I think it will take a long time to stop thinking about it. The characters are unforgettable. I so hope the author will write more fiction books, as a first, this is sublime."
Where the Crawdads Sing,An unforgettable masterpiece,5.0,"I can’t even describe how much I love this book and am in awe of how beautifully it’s written. Where the Crawdads Sing is truly incredible from start to finish and our whole book club have been left astounded by its sheer brilliance.The only conclusion I can find to these handful of bad reviews is a lack of both heart and imagination. I’m all for everyone having an opinion but for people to say this novel is ‘utter rubbish‘, ‘unrealistic’ or ‘lacking’ is simply baffling and downright rude.Extremely excited for the film though it’s hard to see how it will do this book justice! X"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Boring as hell!,1.0,"Over-rated, over-hyped and boring as absolute hell!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Exceptional I every way,5.0,"Remarkable story, really well told. Convincing characters and a final twist. The descriptions of the environment, the emotions and desires are beautiful, dramatic and poetic.It is a story of survival against all the odds, a love story and a murder mystery. Loved this book."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Breathtakingly beautiful book.,5.0,"A joy to read from the first sentence to the last. A rich, fluidly written novel with such emotional depth. Stunning descriptions of the marsh landscape that is Kya’s whole world. Touching portrait of a little girl, abandoned one by one by her family and how she survived prejudice, deprivation and the hands of the law, ultimately to flourish and fall in love. This is a book that will linger in my memory."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Highly recommend, beautifully written and compelling.",5.0,"My favourite genre to read is crime, I bought this book because of its allusion to a mystery and because I thought it would be something a bit different to what I usually read. I’m so glad I bought it because it’s now my favourite book. It’s beautifully written and through the detailed description of nature and the marshes I could clearly picture it in my head, it became a beautiful escape from boring isolation life. It’s heartbreaking, sometimes uncomfortable with reference to abuse but overall beautiful and compelling. The element of crime and murder is present however doesn’t dominate the book. Owens creates a well rounded developed character of Kya, I felt connected to her even though we had nothing in common. Highly recommend this book."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Not an Engaging Read,2.0,"I kept expecting something to happen and it never did.  Also unbelievable about the main character.  Dragged up so who taught her to be clean and brush her teeth etc when she was on her own from such an early age, or does she? Boring and not believable.  Would n't recommend unless you like wildlife, in which case read a book on wild life."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautiful,5.0,"Loved this book from start to finish, the writing was magical, you felt like you were with Kya, like you were watching her grow from the marsh reeds where she watched. One of the most moving books I have read in a while."
Where the Crawdads Sing,The most beautiful book I have read in years <3,5.0,"Recommended by a good friend; the first chapter left me a little concerned this was just going to be a flowery, fluffy book full of wonderful, descriptive narrative regarding the location of the main characters' world.  Persevere and you will be captivated by this fabulous tale and the beautiful writing style. Left me feeling blessed to have had the chance to read it!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Not just a murder mystery,5.0,"I read this book in one day after finding myself unable to stop. I don't feel as though it's a light hearted book you can just pick up and put back down. It was a book that had me thinking and feeling many different emotions throghout. When I finished the book it actually took me time to think about what I thought of it. It wasn't an instant 'i loved that!' But after thinking about it, I realised how brilliant it was, how clever it was. It's not just a 'murder mystery' it's many other things. A book that speaks about murder and love yes, but a book that speaks about race, prejudice, judgement, nature and sexual assault. A book that actually makes you feel and think things."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Simply beautiful and a joy to the senses .  I would recommend this book to everyone who wishes to be taken on an emotional journey into the joy of nature and the strength of the human heart and soul .  It's a book that will live in my mind forever .  This is a story that will stand the test of time, there was nothing i disliked i just loved it all.  l",5.0,"This is a story of abandonment ,love and ultimately deception. There was nothing i disliked i just loved it all.  It is a very rare memorable book that will stand the test of time.  It's magic is to draw you into the story whilst seeing and sensing the marshland it's set in.  It is simply a joy to read and I didn't want to put it down. I would recommend it to all lovers of quality storytelling with a plot that never fails to keep your attention"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Emotive,4.0,"Transports you to another place.  The characters are good.  The location is brought to life and made me want to visit.  An enjoyable read.  Highly recommended if you like good character driven books.  The pace is a little odd, it speeds up a lot towards the end but that didn't spoil it for me."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Couldn’t put the book down,5.0,I began this book at about 4pm after the post arrived. I physically could not put it down and stayed up until 6 am until I finished it. I felt I knew the characters so personally and had so many feelings for them all. Defiantly the best book I have ever read. Wish I could wipe my memory and read it again
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautifully written but wanders too much,3.0,"I have quite mixed feelings on this one. On the one hand, the description of the swamp and marshlands are really evocative and the story has a strong fable element to it, which I really liked. On the other, it did feel to me that it would have really benefitted from stronger editing because it wanders and gets somewhat repetitive at times. That said, I would still recommend it."
Where the Crawdads Sing,The marsh holds its secrets,4.0,"A sweetly written book that traces the arc of a lonely and independent life. Left alone when she didn't want to be, Kya learns the hard way not to trust. Misunderstood, mistreated, yet she endures at one with the marsh around her. A carefully constructed book full of empathy, we want Kya not only to survive, but to love and be loved -- even when the world conspires to intrude."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A wonderful debut novel - well worth a read!,5.0,"This book was recommended to me by my daughter after her book club had read it.An extremely well written story with a very detailed description of day-to-day life in the marsh lands of the North Carolina coast in the 1950's and 1960's. Wonderful descriptions of the wildlife and inhabitants of Barkely Cove where Kya Clark becomes a suspect when Chase Andrews is found dead. A murder mystery, coming-of-age story that explores the impact of loneliness and prejudice and keeps you guessing right up to the final pages."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Fantastic book and a must read,5.0,"I was recommended this by a friend of mine and wasn’t sure about it when she was telling me the outline of the story but I downloaded a sample on my kindle as I said I would try it out. The book gripped me from the first paragraph and I literally  couldn’t put it down. The characters, writing and story are fantastic and the map at the beginning really helps to understand and picture things as the story goes on.  I got to the end and was disappointed I had finished it. I will definitely be reading this one again soon."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A wonderful read,5.0,"I loved this book - I got lost in it, couldn't put it down yet didn't want to finish it. A love story, a story of hope...well worth reading."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautifully Written,5.0,This book was so easy to read and so beautiful to picture. Loved the imagery and personification throughout. I wanted to read it slowly just to take in every word! This was a perfect for one of those times where you just want to read a book that doesn't need too much brainpower yet also makes you think and make links quickly with chapters read or chapters to come. Would recommend it to anyone who loves descriptive language in novels as this is beautiful.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Combines the poignance and emotion of a literary novel with the suspense of a thriller.,5.0,"This was a beautifully written book that draws you in immediately. Brilliant characterisation and wonderful descriptions of nature. The author cleverly weaves together carefully constructed characters, the natural surrounding and an enthralling plot, which is all the more gripping because of the emotional attachment we feel to the characters."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Heart breaking and beautiful,5.0,"A young child Kya, deserted by her fractured family, collects mussels to stay alive. This is a wonderful story of loss , survival, exclusion, love and fighting wrongs. Beautifully written ,I have to admit to shedding a few tears. Highly recommend it."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A Beautiful Book - Better than expected,5.0,After reading poor reviews I dreaded reading this book.  But now I have read it I cannot understand those poor reviews.  It had me gripped very soon into the book and I remained entranced throughout.  A lovely poignant story book.  Just shows not to be lead by reviews.  I loved it and wish I hadn’t read it so fast.  5 Stars.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Well written and captivating,4.0,"While the book is very well written and it is a captivating story, it is also a fantastical story and bares belief - small girl surviving on her own with no money and only little help by one good samaritan.  Nevertheless, I highly enjoyed the book."
Where the Crawdads Sing,One of the best books I have read in a long time,5.0,From page one I was engrossed. I am an avid reader and am never without a book to read. Some enjoyable some not so. There are a few that have got me into them from page one and Where The Crawdads Sing is one of them. I haven't quite finished it but will be sorry when I do.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Stretched Credibility.,3.0,Some of the descriptive passages are good but the story takes some believing.  The characters are one-dimensional; the goodies are good and the baddies are bad.  This was our book club book otherwise I would have taken note of other reviews and not bothered to read it.
Where the Crawdads Sing,An enchanting read,5.0,"An enchanting story about a young girl left to raise herself in the marshes intertwines with a murder mystery set several years later.  The two stories dance around each other until they eventually collide and bring the book to a satisfying finish.  Despite the neat twist at the end not feeling quite right, it is a tale which will stay with me for some time."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautiful,5.0,"I read this a few weeks ago and didn’t expect much having not heard the hype. But oh boy it certainly lives up to expectation. I can’t put my finger on why this story has stuck with me and I cannot stop thinking about it... possibly the setting, or the main character who was so likeable and simply written. Whatever it was I adore this book and have already recommended it to many people."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Brilliant!,5.0,"I love this book!  Though unspeakable things take place, it is written so gently, so lovingly.  Then unexpectedly it becomes a mystery about which I came to needed to know  more. Then It became a page turner.  And finally I simply couldn't put it down."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Excellent read.,5.0,"This was my book clubs choice for January, I loved the story immensely I was not sure at the beginning, it was not long before it grabbed me even had me in tears, to the point the ending surprised me but on reflection perhaps not, get reading folks."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Marsh Girl,5.0,"Marvellous ! A story that has stunning scenery, poetry and a perfect plot. My favourite novel of 2019 and ideal of bookclub discussion. How lucky we are to have an author of such singular talent to write for us. Everything about ‘Where the Crawdads sing’ is a marvel. A ‘ must read.’"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Couldn't put it down!,5.0,"I'd heard good things about this book so decided to give it a go. I'm particular with my book choices as i have very little spare time to read (sadly) but this book did not disappoint. Beautifully written, compelling and heartbreakingly wonderful. If you read one book this year, make it this one!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautifully written.,5.0,Vivid and detailed descriptions of the wildlife and environment  - you feel you are there- provide the backdrop to this poignant story of a young girl abandoned to fend for herself in the swamp lands of North Carolina. I enjoyed every moment of this book.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Excellent read,5.0,This story is about Kya ‘the marsh girl’.  Her life in the marshes after she was one by one abandoned by her family. A poignant story of her life and her affinity with nature and her triumph over adversity . Highly recommended an excellent read.
Where the Crawdads Sing,The landscape wins.,5.0,"I suppose, being very critical, some of the lesser characters are pretty one dimensional but I don't really care because the main character, the landscape and wildlife were so beautifully and sympathetically written that I didn't really notice that as I was reading. Thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A most enjoyable read,5.0,I was recommended this book and I have found it hard to put down. It seems unimaginable for a little girl to be abandoned by her parents and siblings and she managed to stay alive with grit and determination. Her friend Tate taught her to read and with her painting skills she wrote and drew objects she loved from the Marsh. An exceptional plot and story.
Where the Crawdads Sing,More about wetlands of America,4.0,"I chose this book for a book club read. I have yet to find out how others enjoyed and/or appreciated it.I did enjoy it and learnt more about the wetlands of America, the wildlife and the inhabitants. The storylinewas good too."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Brilliant book,5.0,I loved this book so much I've bought it for 4 friends so far. They all love it. Bring on the film but be very careful about who is cast in the leading role. Does the little lad in Lion have a kid sister living in the deep south of the States?
Where the Crawdads Sing,A beautiful story,5.0,Just finished this novel and it’s left me quite speechless. I just loved this book. The writing is fantastic with amazing vivid descriptions of the nature and beauty of the Marsh. ReallyEnjoyed how the plot goes back and forth in time between the murder in 1969 and also looking back on Kya’s life from the early ‘50’s up until that point. I completely fell in love with the character and was left quite emotional at the end of it. A must read.
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Poignant story of prejudice and isolation, courage and spirit",5.0,Found it a little slow to start but the development of the character into the young woman meant I strongly identified with her. The author beautifully recreated the landscape of the marsh in my mind and her articulation of the characters made them real and believable. I physically felt the pain of abandonment and the shame of being an outcast. Beautiful book

The characters are well developed and you really get an emotional bond with kya. It is the only book that has not gone down the 'normal tour's and provides shocking revelations.

Where the Crawdads Sing,Brilliant story telling,5.0,"Wonderfully writing with great attention to detail. It captures the extraordinary life of the marshes and we get to experience it in all its glory . Kya is a compelling character with a tragic  and lonely life, always an outsider.

Where the Crawdads Sing,Ok if you want something easy to read.,3.0,This book was...ok. It’s hugely over-hyped. It started out well but I don’t think the side characters were well developed. The only one I felt I got to know aside from Kya was Jumpin’. Certain parts felt rushed and other parts were overly explained. There was far too much descriptive text about the marsh throughout the book. I ended up skim reading those bits.I didn’t finish the book caring much about any of the characters and that says a lot.

Her treatment by those around her resonates still today, as we see those who are different with fear and suspicious. Love still works it hopeful magic.If you love stories set in the mystery that is North Carolina, you can't go wrong with Where The Crawdads Sing"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Let you imagination take you to Kya and her Marsh,5.0,"I would not normally have picked this up but it was a Claire Mackintosh book of month so I decided to give it a go and I am so thankful that I did. Never before has a book moved me to tears like this one did. I have never been very good at imagining the characters or places in the books I read I just want to know what happens and who did it. But with this I was totally swept away to the Marsh and to Kya and her gulls the images were so clear in my mind. It is beautifully written and is a story of courage, love and loss. A beautiful book and a brilliant story."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Social isolation in the swamps of Louisiana,4.0,Started this book a few times and wasnt particularly taken by it. This time persevered and really enjoyed it. Descriptions of the swamps amazing enveloping you in sights and sounds. Story brilliantly explains the feelings of isolation of those who are different.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Great story,5.0,Excellent who dunnit where the background is so well described by the author that it is another character in the tale. Pity that the courtroom scenes are so lacking in our heroine's thoughts and feelings.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Good read...disappointing ending,4.0,Really enjoyed this book...great writing especially the natural history part but the ending let it down. There wasn't a twist or surprise at all as reviewed by the publisher...The ending just faded away ...nothing about how the victim in the story came to his demise...shame.

I have passed it around my family and they love it too. I expect it will get made into a film (which won’t be as good as the book).
Where the Crawdads Sing,Intrigue like no other!,5.0,"This book drew me in to Kya's young life, initially, like no other. Wonderfully written, the imagery brought to life at every page turn. Her innocent and yet essential relationships to help her through to adulthood and beyond were all-inspiring.  The marsh, the beach, and inhabitants therein are all magical.  Be warned... you will not put it down!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,An enjoyable read,5.0,"A very enjoyable read.I had been to the Outer Banks of North Carolina,where this book is set, so was captivated by the descriptions of the area and touched by the life that Kya was forced to endure when left alone at a young age.The murder and ensuing trial was an added bonus."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Beautiful evocative rich, heart wrenching and heart warming",5.0,"When an author describes a place so well that you feel you know it like the back of your hand.

Such a well told story with a very satisfying ending."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Nice prose.,3.0,"Nicely written but you must be willing to suspend your disbelief in order to enjoy it, which I suppose is true of many works of fiction, as it is a little far fetched. Reminded me of Uncle Tom’s Cabin!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,I loved it!,5.0,This is a really brilliant read inspiring empathy with the core characters and huge involvement with Kya. It explores the working of the USA's Deep South and the white/coloured issues.I loved it!
Where the Crawdads Sing,Nature and the wild.,3.0,"Mostly liked this book. The setting and descriptions of wild life were fabulous. The plot was good. I would like to have believed a child could grow up alone in the marshes but was not convinced and that was the main flaw in the novel, and the reason I gave three stars.Anyone interested in birds and nature would love this book."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Far fetched story,1.0,"Most far fetched story. How would a totally illiterate 7year old end up writing books. Also how could she go unnoticed for all those years, it just wound me up so was very pleased when the book ended!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,"To enjoy, one has to suspend belief at the likely reality of the plot!",5.0,"Thought this might be a ‘girly’ book but enjoyed the read immensely. One really has to suspend belief at the plausibility if the plot, with too many implausible occurrences but, hey, in these strange times why not?"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautiful - made me cry!,5.0,"I found this book slightly boring at first - the same stuff was happening over and over again (Kya just doing random stuff around the marsh) - every time the plot was going somewhere it stopped.But, towards the end of the book, the pace becomes a lot quicker. I became very invested in it. I even cried at the end, and only two books have made me do this, the other one being Wild - Cheryl Strayed. For this reason, I will love and remember this book forever.I lent it to my mum and she cried too."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Best book for ages,5.0,Unusual story set in mid states USA. Sad childhood of a little girl who we follow to becoming a woman. Without care she has to survive alone. Very moving- sure will make a good film. Highly recommend

Where the Crawdads Sing,Being different,5.0,"Incredible story- not giving anything away but the ending tied up the mystery.  Loved the character Kya and how people reacted to and against her.  The speech that Tom Milton makes tells of how her life could have been so different if society could have helped her but look at what she had become,virtually, by herself."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant",5.0,"Has everything. Nature, shades of the Snow Goose, authentic romance, drama, unpredictable, beautiful writing.

We both loved it. Don't hesitate. Buy it."

It's horrendous outcomes yet it's amazing opportunity to show how human loneliness and it's consequences can be overcome and won no matter what!

Where the Crawdads Sing,Started off well.....,2.0,"I tried the sample and enjoyed that so decided to read the whole book, but was disappointed as the characters became more and more one-dimensional and cliched over time... it's a pretty unbelievable development of the main character and after a while I felt like I was reading some ""tragic"" love story in a  young adult novel. I found myself saying ""come on....really??"" more and more through the second half of the book and sadly wish I'd picked a different recommendation in the end to be honest...!"

Where the Crawdads Sing,Great story,5.0,"This is the only book I've ever read that I wanted to reread it immediately.  Loved it!  Such descriptive writing I felt like I was Kya (the lead character).  I felt her pain, her excitement, her anger.  Highly recommended"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Good as reviews,4.0,I enjoyed this book a deviation from my usual reads.Slightly over descriptive but it does draw you into the characters and environmentsSomewhat predictable but I read in 2 days.
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Stunning, evocative, brilliant",5.0,"If there were 6 stars this novel would deserve it. The brilliant descriptions of the wildlife of the marshes makes them as real as the beautifully portrayed central human characters. But this story also holds a mirror up to all of us, and if we dare, lets us reflect on our own prejudice. All this is wrapped up in a heart stopping suspense thriller of the best kind."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Kept me reading for the first time in 2 years,5.0,"Best book I can remember. Just could not put it down and very sad to finish it. Not the normal book I would go for, but definitely the best. Would highflying recommend."
Where the Crawdads Sing,4* read,4.0,"A book out of my usual condo zone but what a great, moving book that kept you reading.This covered such an emotional rollercoaster  for the various characters from nurturing to loathing.Would recommend this for others to make you realise just how easy some of us have our lives and how grateful we should be."
Where the Crawdads Sing,I fell in love with this book,5.0,"Whilst the story gets off to a slow start, I gradually fell in love with Kya and the beautiful landscapes of coastal North Carolina. The story draws you into the rhythms of nature and the power of the connection between humans and the natural world. This is juxtaposed with the cruelty and horror of man’s prejudice and discrimination against perceived difference. A moving portrayal of the journey from rejection to acceptance."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A brilliant and compelling book,5.0,"A wonderful, moving and compelling book that works on many levels... a love story, a mystery and a poetic, timely and inspirational appreciation of the value of connecting with nature."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A diffferent story,5.0,"So different from my usual crime reading material preference.  This was a superbly written story, written by someone who knows her subject well, and with an unexpected conclusion."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Great book!,4.0,I enjoyed this book. Thought it was easy to read and it kept my interest throughout. Not sure about the negative reviews. Enjoyed the descriptions answer general story.
Where the Crawdads Sing,A refreshing different read for all!,5.0,"This beautifully written, full of fascinating detail and accuracy, made me cry twice in sympathy with characters. It comes to a boil about three quarters of the way through and I couldn't put it down. The Marsh Girl as she was called defies all prejudice against her and shows herself to be pure and clear in her lifestyle with an inate love of the wildlife in her marsh. I loved this book."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Fabulous,5.0,Details about the marsh and the survival of a young girl in very hard conditions. Exceptionally emotional to see how the girl goes through pain and loss as she grows into a young woman
Where the Crawdads Sing,Just brilliant,5.0,"I was spellbound by this riveting tale of a life so far removed from the present day , and yet well within living memory .

Where the Crawdads Sing,Murder in the Marshes,5.0,"This is a wonderful book about some very delicate topics: alcoholism, ostracism, marital abuse, mental illness, child abandonment and revenge to name a few. But it’s also about love and kindness and how survival is possible with the smallest seeds of hope. The plot oscillates between past and present and a murder investigation that will have you riveted. Delia Owens sets the story in the environmentally rich North Carolina marshes. A highly recommended read."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Feel yourself transported!,5.0,I always know within the first chapter whether a book has drawn me in initially I thought the story was good but then all of a sudden I found myself there in the marshes almost like I wasn't reading a book I was experiencing it like an onlooker. I was hooked. I won't ruin the plot but if you pick this title up you will not be disappointed.
Where the Crawdads Sing,A deeply thoughtful whodunnit,5.0,Beautifully written a story of independence and survival. A view into our society and the result of our judgement and how we often incorrectly express our judgement
Where the Crawdads Sing,A stunning story of strength and survival,5.0,This book is an original and engrossing story of a young girl who survives alone with just tendrils of connections to a few people who show her kindness. The narrative involves a murder mystery entwined in lyrical tale of love and survival.Good luck putting it down!

Where the Crawdads Sing,Sadness and Joy!,5.0,I loved this book which conveys a sadness out of loneliness but joy out of simple pleasures and interests.  It offers no excuse for the cruelty of prejudice in all it's forms and portrays the kindness of a few accepted and rejected in preference for a solitary life  The marsh is brought to life in this beautifully written novel with twists and turns in the life of a gifted 'orphan'.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Brilliant.,5.0,"Intriguing and  spellbinding.  Believable and devastating, how poor little Kya was treated.  But how things changed for the better.  Then the last piece in place."
Where the Crawdads Sing,The best thing I have read in a long time,5.0,"A beautifully written book, narrating a poignant tale in such a way,  it transports you to the marshes it describes and makes you feel that you have actually been there. The characters are rich and real and the story unfolds right up to the very last page , after which I felt a sense of loss having nothing left to read- I didn’t want the story to end!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Brilliant,5.0,"Could not put it down. Lovely language and an understanding of nature and ecology. Worth whatever you have to pay. Myself an author, I'm jealous of Delia's skills."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Stick with it!,5.0,"Slow to start because you have to adapt to the dialect, but once it’s clicked in you’ll enter Kya’s world of a strange charm and challenges. I absolutely loved this book. It’s unique and compelling."
Where the Crawdads Sing,JA''S kindle,5.0,"This is the most beautiful book I have ever read. Simply wonderful. Resorcefulness,tenacity,longing are all included in the nature of this writer. Please write another novel. To suffer the prejudice as a six year old child-onwards. I urge everyone to read it. Thank you. JA"

Where the Crawdads Sing,Well written,4.0,Loved this book but not quite 5 stars due to a confusing aspect at the court case - won't say what aspect as would be a spoiler. Nevertheless highly recommended.
Where the Crawdads Sing,A fascinating story of survival and ultimate fulfilment in the swamp lands of Carolina.,5.0,"I could not put this book down and kept reading into the small hours. The combination of the small girls survival against great odds was interesting and inspiring and the kindness from unexpected quarters was very moving.  The description of the swamp land and it’s wildlife was a completely new world for me as I knew nothing about this part of the United States,I could have done without the murder/mystery plot as I think the book could have stood on its own without it."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"A beautiful, almost poetical novel, of love, nature and survival",5.0,"I read this over two nights - often with blurry eyes. I was sobbing with emotion by the end.A powerful love story. Far-fetched and almost mystical at times, but these early irritations were engulfed by the gentle but persistent details of nature’s beauty and the reality of human resilience. A moving novel that will stay with me for some time. Read this book."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Poetic and immersive.,5.0,"This novel’s description is so richly textured the marsh comes alive. I could feel the heat and scent of Kya’s world, hear the calls of the gulls. A truly immersive reading experience. Magnificent"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautiful,4.0,It took me some time to get into this book. In the end I paid to get an audio version from that moment I was gripped. I could visualise Kia the Marsh Girl. Her sad lonely existence enriched by her love of nature. The book so eloquently teaches about prejudice and bias against those who are different. It’s set in a time when women and coloureds were seen as inferior. I feel quite bereft that I’ve finished the book. I would recommend

Where the Crawdads Sing,Loved it,5.0,This book is so different .It is beautifully written and the characters are so real. I am so glad I read the book before a film is released as I can’t imagine a film doing it justice. Kya is an amazing character so beautifully portrayed. This book will last.

Where the Crawdads Sing,Worthy of a read,4.0,"Chosen for our book club read, it scored an average of 8 out of 10.  Written well it placed you in the scene of the marsh but I personally failed to engage with the character and therefore found Some aspects of the story dubious.  It was an excellent choice for a book club read enabling a good discussion and review."

Where the Crawdads Sing,Swept along like the tides...,5.0,"My goodness what a story. It has been many years since I have been so absorbed in a novel, the natural world beautifully described, the convergence of the past and more recent events wonderfully builds the tension, the sense of isolation from humanity but not from the creatures of the marsh all makes this a  great read. 5 + mavericktendency stars for this one!"

Where the Crawdads Sing,The twist at the end! You know but you don’t!,5.0,Unusual story of child neglect and abuse in a swamp/marshland setting. It is a tale of survival and loss. I can’t wait to see it on screen with Daisy Edgar-Jones (Normal People) in the lead role.

Where the Crawdads Sing,Disappointing,2.0,I’d read my rave reviews about this book but found it very disappointing.  It seems as if the author wanted to ‘jazz’ up a story with a ‘whodunnit’ ending.

In the early parts, it depicts the harshness of life, transitions into a coming-of-age story, adds a dash of Mills & Boon romance and finishes with a John Grisham style drama.

Where the Crawdads Sing,"Where the Crawdads Sing is an exquisite anthem of survival, love, and the unexpected",5.0,"Exquisite. So beautifully and artfully written. Delia Owens has penned a heart-wrenchingly original story that took this reader into an unknown world. It captures and affirms what happens, at a cellular level, when a very young person experiences trauma, abandonment, profound loneliness and unrelenting grief from loss. At once it also offers a window onto the soul of a survivor. This book is one of the very best I have ever read."

Where the Crawdads Sing,Not for me,2.0,"I’ve never given up on a book before but sadly had to with this one. I felt it wasn’t moving quickly enough for me.

Where the Crawdads Sing,"A captivating tale of nature, love and survival",5.0,"This is the first time I have ever been moved to write a review of a novel, so brilliantly did Owens weave the images of the marsh and portray the vulnerabilities of Kya.

A simply brilliant read."

Where the Crawdads Sing,Not convincing but well written,3.0,"A good story, well written and well read (Audible version), but flawed.You need to suspend credibility that an 8 year old girl could survive independently and gain a degree level education after just a few tutorials in reading.But the ultimate flaw is in the conclusion. Would someone who has never caught a bus before be capable of navigating complex timetables to return overnight whilst carrying two full disguises in a cardboard suitcase? No. So the conclusion spoiled it for me. There were other flaws in the conclusion too, but I don’t want to detail them too much as it gives away too much of the plot.I wonder if this is more popular in the US where readers may be more interested in recent social history?I was far from convinced."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Simply mesmerising,5.0,"🐚I jumped at the chance to be read this, because I felt like I must have been one of the last people on the planet to read this book - so I was dying to finally know what all the hype was about!🐚Being first and foremost a murder mystery, I was drawn in to this book quickly and soon became obsessed with being back in the marsh with Kya.  I could hear the whistle of the wind in the trees and the splash and gurgle of the water in the marsh.  With deliciously lucid and vivid prose; It was such a joyful escape of a read.🐚Owens is a real wizard with words.  I adored her sumptuous descriptions of the marsh and her turn of phrase really gave the marsh its own character in the novel.  Her writing is effortlessly elegant and so wonderfully easy to read and lose yourself in.🐚Whilst this has been dubbed a “Coming of Age” novel, (a statement which I don’t at all disagree with), Where The Crawdads Sing, in my opinion, is so much more.  It depicts how a human survives abandonment and complete isolation; learning to fend for herself and become totally self sufficient.  In time we learn how these sad circumstances impact on her emotional and social interactions with other humans later on in life.🐚A breathtaking, soulful and simply mesmerising book; I have no doubt that Where The Crawdads Sing will be one of my top reads of 2020."
Where the Crawdads Sing,An average story. Feel free to pass it by.,3.0,"It takes Reese Witherspoon to flash a book cover and the whole world goes nuts for the novel! I understand why Reese would feel for the book - it describes in minute detail life of the the marsh of North Carolina and Atlantic coast - something that is close to her heart. But this does not make ""Where the Crawdads Sing"" a great novel. It is not. It is not a great love story, not a thrilling murder mystery and it is not a great detective story. It is just an okay read.After all the rave reviews I was expecting something exceptional but was completely underwhelmed. The characters were underdeveloped and lacked any depth, the plot was rushed and the little twist in the end did not blow my socks off. I did not really care for the twist.There were a couple of chapters that made me hold my breath and wonder how the story would develop, for this I give it three stars. But overall - feel free to pass this by."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Sorry, just not for me...",2.0,"Gorgeous nature writing but a story which I found frankly sentimental, full of cliches, melodramatic and just oh so predictable. I found it difficult to buy into this romanticized vision of the 'wild child of nature', and long descriptions of marshland flora and fauna, while poetic, felt stranded aimlessly without a story to fill the foreground. Just not for me, sorry."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Haunting novel set on the marshlands of North Carolina,4.0,"– Set in the fictional town of Barkley Cove (near Asheville), Kya is only around six when her mother walks out leaving her and her brother with their alcoholic and violent father. The vision of her standing by the roadside waiting for her mother’s return was heartbreaking and that set the tone for the rest of the novel. This is Kya’s story – abandoned, left alone, left to live on her wits and her only constant support and carer is Mother Nature herself. Kya spends her days in the marshes, on the land and on the water when she takes out her father’s boat. She becomes quite the skilled navigator as she grows up on this boat and realises that this is her only true constant she can rely on. Maybe it will be her escape too.Into this world then comes danger – a man is found murdered in the very waters, Kya calls home.Much of the novel is an insight into life on the marshes, how others see Kya and how she survives. This is when the novel is at its slowest, yet its most lyrical. I loved spending time here, wallowing in the descriptions of the flora and fauna around me. I swear I could hear the buzz of the insects and the ripple of the water. This book would work particularly well as an audio book because of that. Not only that however. The language of this book is quite something too. Written in local dialect, the novel reads like a Harper Lee era novel, a Barbara Kingsolver book and others in that vein. IT reads like a classic novel of 1950s America. Hard to believe it’s a debut.As life in the marsh carries on, the novel does slow down considerably until Kya meets a boy. Abandoned by him, she meets another called Chase, the very man found dead at the start. The locals fear this strange ‘marsh girl’ must have something to do with it. This is where the novel gets very interesting for me as the author has clearly done her research into what life was like back then. Small town American mindsets, suspicion against outsiders, racial overtones and the role of women. Not to mention a young woman who has grown up on the marshes alone. There’s a lot to discuss for book clubs here.What really drew me in to this novel were the descriptions of the scenery and landscape, but what kept me there was the examination of loneliness and survival. I wasn’t entirely sure at first that a young girl could do half of what Kya did, but then I wasn’t raised on a marsh in 1950s America., so I can’t really say.I admit to not knowing what a crawdad was before reading this novel. A crawdad is a crawfish elsewhere but where the book is set, it’s a crawdad. They don’t sing either but they live far away from anywhere, deep in the wild bush. Here, things are wild, raw, and far from civilization.What the book lacks in fast-paced plot, it more than makes up for in an insight into a young girl’s life, survival and strength. The landscape jumps from the page and is extremely vivid and richly drawn. All in all, I felt as if this was a novel I had to experience slowly and lounging in a big fat armchair, a pot of wind rushes beside me, to ensure I got the most from it."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Beautifully written, woeful conclusion.",2.0,"I really enjoyed the writing style of this book - the figurative language, the beautifully crafted setting and the characters (if you overlooked the cliches) . Unfortunately towards the end it all took a dramatic turn for the worse. It felt like a publisher or editor had said it needed “more” and a murder mystery was shoehorned in. I would have been happy for it all to have been a tragic accident and left satisfied with the two main characters finally declaring their love. At that point I felt the story had come to a natural end.Unfortunately, the author then embarked on a rapid “tying up of knots” and the whole  plot became laughable. I cannot for the life of me see what the point of the poet revelation was, nor why we had to have a dash through the main character’s remaining years, and could have wept at the “secret under the floorboards scene”. I have never been so disappointed in the ending of a book that seemed so full of promise in the opening chapters."
Where the Crawdads Sing,4.5 stars,5.0,"WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING was a singular story, carried by a cast of many in the background but only Kya in the foreground. It was a story evoking strong emotion, anger and empathy and I experienced all of these feelings many times whilst reading. It was also a tough reading experience from a contextual perspective in a number of way and therefore there may be trigger themes for some readers.Kya was a young girl, a ‘marsh girl’ abandoned by first her mother, then her siblings and finally by her father. She resided in a shack in the marshlands and learnt how to live. This aspect was much of the early book and my heart ached on reading. Kya was vulnerable, naive but a survivor with the kind of resilience that was hewn out of circumstance; it was do or die. Seeing Kya’s unfulfilled longing for love and relationships was distressing. There were themes of racism, prejudice and extreme poverty. I felt that these aspects were written exceptionally well with such tangibility.There were people who came into Kya’s life and made it bearable, Jumpin’, Mable and Tate. I adored Jumpin’ and I loved Tate’s desire to help Kya without wanting anything from her. The lack of plain sailing was inevitable but it stung to read how things turned out. Chase was rotten from the first encounter and it was hard to see Kya’s naivety lead her in a sticky direction. The mystery that later unfolded was fascinating in a painful way.The narrative and description in this book was decadent in terms of the flora and fauna but there were no holds barred in terms of the reality of marsh and shack life. Delia Owens had a way of bringing nature to life, birds, trees and feathers, through their sights and sounds. My visualisation was vivid and that was down to the descriptive prose.I was grateful for the time frame and the journey in this book. I was relieved to have answers at the end and some surprises. This book has the kind of story that would appeal widely, regardless of what genre you might prefer; it is worth any reader’s time. WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING was a rare case of a book that lasts a lifetime and I sense it could also stay with me as long.Thank you to Corsair and Little Brown for the proof copy for review."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Really?,2.0,"I am quite stunned by the excitement over this novel. Do people still believe in this fantasy romance? Yes, the language and descriptive passages depicting nature are lovely.  However, the self-education of this young woman is simply unrealistic. Most bothersome of all is that we are still being asked to accept that the way to success for girls is through the generosity of privileged white men. I really would have hoped we had progressed beyond this. Hugely disappointing and a great opportunity missed."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Interesting story but too disjointed for me,2.0,"The story is one of Kya Clark and follows her whole life.  From infancy and gradually being abandoned by her family in a shack on the edge of a North Carolina swamp, throughout her evolution into a womanhood and then beyond her life.  Her various battles against adversity transform her from a societal outcast to a ‘successful citizen’ in terms of the traditional Western metrics of achieving status in career and relationship.  The premise itself being an overarching cliché.Conceptually, the novel interweaves the social politics of 1960s North Carolina with ecology and attempts to interject artistic tangents via descriptions of Kya’s painting and poetry, drawing comparisons with Elizabeth Gilbert’s Signature of All Things.  Disappointingly for me the story then centres around Kya’s romantic interests and the influence of her heterosexual relationships on her life including abandonment and a murder trial complete with courtroom drama to conclude.  I thought that this was disproportionately accounted for compared to the length of time she spent alone and over emphasised male dependency.The romantic descriptions of life on the marsh and coexistence with the nature was my favourite element of the novel and provided sufficient novelty and literary competency to negate some of the other issues I had with the piece.Generally, I thought the story too broad and not, by any means, deep enough to develop credible characters or situations.  For the narrative to work for me, I would have liked to have seen accurate representations of social and racial discrimination, alluded to but not developed farther than a mention.  This missed the opportunity that To Kill a Mockingbird seized and undermined the structure of the story, making Kya’s personal progress, the police investigation, and the court case unbelievable.  I think there is a danger in glossing over such important issues, in that it serves to minimise the damage done by prejudice and supports inaccurate historical representation.  I also found the conclusion of the story not in keeping with Kya’s character portrayed throughout as compassionate and fair.  Other inconsistencies included the standard of Kya’s education and artistic competency given minimal resources, the level of self-sufficiency she developed with little support or example and the level of success she achieved as a disadvantaged woman.In summary, I found the story interesting but suspending reality on the topics the novel attempts to cover didn’t work for me."
Where the Crawdads Sing,How to explain the path taken,4.0,"In the marshland of North Carolina, still unspoilt in the early 1950s, inhabited only by a few  down-and-outs or those escaping justice,  branded “marsh trash” by the residents of nearly Barkley Cove, six-year-old Kya knows there is something amiss when her mother leaves their  decrepit coastal shack, carrying a suitcase. Kya’s  four older siblings soon follow suit, driven away by the violence of their drunken father. Expected to earn her keep by doing chores, she  avoids him as much as possible, seeking refuge collecting shells and watching herons  with flocks of  the gulls soaring over the lagoon shore. Bribed with the promise of chicken pie, Kya endures a day of bullying at the  town school, but evades the truancy officers thereafter. Abandoned by her father, she manages to survive alone with the help of strangers, including a boy called Tate who teaches her to read. So she somehow grows into a  beautiful and intelligent woman, desperately lonely but unable to fit into the community of Barkley Cove, where she is scorned as the “Marsh Girl”.This storyline alternates and contrasts with a  mystery in 1969 when the body of Chase Andrews is discovered in the mud at the base of an old fire tower near Barkley Cove, with foul play soon suspected. Handsome, athletic popular and married, he is also known to have been a womaniser, with Kya  among his list of conquests.This novel is remarkable for its mesmerising descriptions of the natural world, informed by the author’s knowledge as a zoologist combined with a skill which has won her at least one award and plaudits for nature writing. One can visualise every change in the landscape and wildlife as Kya makes her first journey alone by boat between the low-hanging limbs of giant trees, where “duckweed colours the water as green as the leafy ceiling, creating an emerald tunnel”  then out to an estuary where “waves slammed against one another awash in their own white saliva….. breaking with loud booms …. then… flattened into tongues of foam”.The novel is also strong on the psychology of someone who has lost trust through repeated abandonment and also the impact of the world on one accustomed to isolation. So, on her first journey by car to a distant large town,  travel on a main road is akin to a roller coaster without a security harness,  in  contrast to the wide skies of the marshes, mountains are disturbing because the sun keeps setting behind them only to reappear while the tower blocks and crowds of people at her destination are bewildering.Some who know North Caroline have criticised the factual accuracy of certain points but I can accept any errors as “dramatic licence”. It is harder  to deny the implausibility of a young child being able to survive for so long, in apparent perfect health and no major accidents with such poor food, no innoculations.  To have been left in this state is unlikely. Kya’s ability to teach herself to such a high level, express herself so articulately, seems far-fetched. Like many novels, the plot is awash with coincidences, most of the characters are stereotypes, the harshness of Kya’s situation is too often leavened with excessive sentimentality, the final twist is rendered improbable by previous arguments and presented as morally justifiable  when it is in fact questionable.The author herself caught my interest by reason of her time in Africa where she and her former husband  became embroiled in controversy over  their campaigning against ivory poachers, in circumstances which may have inspired this book in some respects.Despite my reservations which are clearly a minority view on this international bestseller, I found it a page-turner and worth reading although I would be interested to know how male readers tend to rate it."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Lives up to all the Hype,5.0,"I love my books but I am always hesitant to read overly hyped reads because they rarely live up to the hype and expectations created. It was for this reason that I had absolutely no interest whatsoever in reading this and only ended up doing so out of a sense of duty when an acquaintance recommended it and gave me their copy. It was one of those awkward cases where I eventually begrudgingly picked it up out of a sense of embarrassment over not being able to say id tried it when i bumped into them..... but how wrong I was....Where the Crawdads Sing had me drawn in hook, line and sinker from the first chapter. Part murder mystery and part coming of age, this book follows the story of Kya (The Marsh Girl) who has been all but abandoned by her family as a child and forced to rear herself in a shack in the Georgian swamps and marshlands. These same Marshlands are so beautifully drawn for the reader by Delia Owens that they become a character in their own right. And please don't misunderstand - that previous sentence is exactly the kind of claptrap to put me off reading under the assumption that this is a pompous, pretentious, boring book but it isn't at all!! Quite the opposite. Kya's story is one of resilience and also a lesson in the age old adage to not judge a book by it's cover - seen as little more than vermin by the local people, we the reader are privy to the highly intelligent, gentle, strong individual Kya really is. Throughout her story, we also meet some other great characters like Jumpin the kindly local swamp garage man who takes Kya under his wing.I zipped through this book and urge anyone like me who had written off this book to give it a chance - it was nothing like a expected and is now one of my favourite books iv read this year (And iv read a lot!). A great read and highly recommended by this Doubting Thomas!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,A beautiful book which transports you to a different place and era,5.0,"I loved everything about Where the Crawdads Sing. It is the story of Kya Clark who is living in a marsh in North Carolina. Her mother was from a good, reasonably well-off family, but has found herself and her five young children living in this impoverished situation with her husband who is a drunkard and abusive. One by one the family leave due to abusive situation leaving just Kya, the youngest child aged 6, and her father. After a rocky period with just the two of them, sometimes good, sometimes bad, the father disappears leaving Kya to fend for herself in their shack in the marsh on the edge of Barkley Cove town.It is a heartbreaking and heartwarming story of how Kya’s resilience comes to the fore and she learns to fend for herself with the help of a few people in Barkley Cove who are kind to her.  Mostly she is alone in the marsh but Jumpin’, owner of Bait and Gas store, and his wife, Mabel, make sure Kya has clothes, food, gas for her boat and basic necessities to survive. She also meets Tate, a friend of her brother Jodie, who is about three years older than her and shares her love of nature. Tate teaches her to read and looks out for her but then he gets a place at college so moves on.Kya was born in 1945 so most of the book is about her growing up in the 1950s dealing with her situation and isolation. Another thread of the book is in 1969 when Chase Andrews, a local football hero and womaniser, is found dead. The circumstances are unclear and many think he was murdered. Kya is one of the many women he has preyed on and deceived and there is suspicion on her as most of the local are prejudiced against her.I know many say you need to suspend belief to enjoy parts of this book but I was more than happy to do that as reading it in 2020 covid times I was more than delighted to suspend belief and be transported so vividly and evocatively by this author to a different time and different location. I am not surprised to learn the author is also a published naturalist as I loved learning so many things about marsh land and nature thorough this delightful book. It also has poetry and court room drama. A lovely book that will stick in my mind for a long time. It would make a beautiful film."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Marsh Girl,4.0,"This book has received a lot of hype, so my book group decided to read it and decide for ourselves. It was certainly beautifully written and the narration by Cassandra Campbell was excellent, but I found the first part of the book a bit slow going. I'm also not much of a fan of court cases in my reads and although this one wasn't overly detailed, it was still a court case.Set in the 1950’s and 60’s, the narrative follows Kya, a ""Marsh Girl"", who is brought up in a shack on the shores of the marshes. She is the youngest in her family but feels happy and loved, until one by one, all her family leave and just she and her father remain. She tries to cook and clean, but at the age of 7, she doesn't have a lot of experience. Her father is a drunk and a bully but she persuades him to teach her to use his boat and they appeared to form something of a bond, until he disappears too and finally, she is all alone.As she grows into a woman she finds herself attracted to a couple of the men who sometimes frequent the marshes. Will she find love or just sorrow?I Googled images of the marshes of the North Carolina Coast and they were really quite beautiful, well deserving of the poetic language of this book. Even though Kya was so poor, she appreciated the beauty and grew to love the loneliness of her surroundings. Her detailed observations of the flora and fauna were impressive for a child who had never attended school.I don't know what I was expecting, I hadn't done much research before starting this book. I'm certainly glad I read (listened to) it but for me it wasn't quite a five star read."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Definitely NOT To Kill a Mockingbird,2.0,"I had read some reviews and was keen to read this, given others had likened it to the classic Harper Lee novel but I was disappointed and wouldn't be in a rush to recommend it to friends so I am shocked this is still sitting so high on the list of popular books.The upside: it's a quick read (especially if you skim over repetition!) and I did keep turning the pages. The descriptions of the marsh and its creatures are captivating and it also attempts to tackle class and race discrimination.The downsides: The court case is laughably unrealistic: there is no tangible evidence of the crime committed, there is little plausibility that all elements would have come together to allow the perpetrator to commit the deed in the first place (a LOT of things would have had to have gone their way), the lawyers are constantly leading their own witnesses, etc. Decisions are also made by the author that make no sense: for example, why did we only find out about Jodie's scar so late? Why not tell us that detail earlier so that when the man with the scar shows up at the door, we the readers KNOW who it is because the detail was made significant earlier, rather than needing a flashback? At one particular character's death, I felt nothing and I really should have felt something because they played such a significant part in the book, but it was weakened by a death immediately preceding the death that should have had meaning (trying not to give anything away here!) so as to render both a footnote.I'm keen that when this is turned into a screenplay, that some very fundamental issues are fixed."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Lyrical, with a tough undercurrent",5.0,"This was given to me for a Christmas present by my daughter. I did wonder about it as I read the jacket's notes, but once I'd read the first few paragraphs I was hooked.  I gather that this is the author's first novel. It will be a hard act to follow.  Kya is the youngest child of a clearly dysfunctional family, whose siblings leave as soon as they can leaving her with a mother worn down by her husband's inability to remain sober and hold down a job. The mother walks down the track, never to return. Eventually the father disappears too.So far,so potentially depressing, but this is not a Misery memoir. It is a record of a resourceful little girl who has learnt from her inadequate parents to survive on what Nature provides. The descriptions of the swamp environs, the plants and wildlife is at times too detailed, reminding the reader of the author's ""day job"", but it sets Kya precisely in her world. Whilst some in the ""proper"" world of town and society mock and reject her, there are continuous examples of those who do good quietly to make sure this Child of Nature is able to survive.  Kya's talents are finally recognised and encouraged by the boy who shares her interests, which leads to Kya sharing her world through her drawings and descriptions.  When the death of her rejected lover leads to her arrest those who have always supported her quietly come together to protect her. Imagine a wild shy woodland creature being confined and pining, then watch how she is quietly watched, protected and released.  That in many ways is Kya's story, ""Nature red in tooth and claw""."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Beautiful, well worth reading it",5.0,"I picked this book based on all the great reviews I've been seeing and hearing from other readers and I wasn't a bit disappointed. This story is a real masterpiece and absolutely stunning work of fiction. I don't know why Delia Owens was waiting this long to treat us with her beautiful prose, but I hope this is not her last piece of work and we'll read many more astonishing stories from her.This book is mesmerising and really beautifully written, I don't think I read anything like this ever before. I was completely consumed by this unique story and was always worried for Kya, our main heroine, her well-being and at times was hypnotised by her strength and her ability to survive despite her unfortunate circumstances.Owen Delia's knowledge about the nature is really evident and apparent in this book and I loved her human traits comparison with those of the animals traits. This comparison gives reader a better understanding of characters behaviour and the perspective of the events surrounding the story.The author done great job developing all the characters. It was addicting to watch Kya grow and experience all she's done and who she became to survive when everyone she loved were leaving her one by one. It's a heartbreaking tale and while majority of the book is filled with prejudice, narrow mindedness and neglect, there is a fair dose of hope, acceptance, admiration and love.I really recommend to give this unique story a go and I can't wait for the screen adaptation of this book."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Powerful Prose,5.0,"Good books get passed around my family with recommendations to one another, and recently for ‘Where The Crawdads Sing’ I am the third generation to award it a 5-star rating.  My family are not alone as I note the book has been in the Sunday Times best seller list of fiction paperbacks for over 30 weeks.  I ‘googled’ crawdad to learn that it is a sort of crayfish crustacean, and there is a myth that if you go far enough into the wilderness and there is nothing but nature, then you will hear crawdads sing.Being in the wilderness and living with nature is at the heart of the book where a young girl learns about life through her interactions and survival in marshlands after being abandoned by her family.  She is totally alone in both physical and mental terms and has to provide for herself.  A few individuals help but generally she is scorned and ridiculed by inhabitants of the nearby village, and she opts-out of schooling after a single day with bullying.  Author Delia Owens skilfully tells the story of ‘Where The Crawdads Sing’ with great empathy.  Also she brings informative insights from her own background as a wildlife scientist, and she writes beautifully with magnificent imagery.The book is beautifully written and its structure has chapters headed by various explanatory words or by naming whoever is appropriate to the experience being recorded, and it shifts backwards and forwards between 1951 when the ‘Marsh Girl’ was six years old to her death in 2009.  A few people help including a young boy destined for a research career in biology and ecology who teaches her to read and write, and later a popular local football hero who takes advantage of her, and a lawyer defending her in the face of bigoted villagers.  These are some of the ingredients of a gripping and compelling read, but there is so much more.It is difficult to identify a genre for ‘Where The Crawdads Sing’ as there are multiple layers including coming of age, romance, murder mystery, police procedural, courtroom drama etc.  In all its forms it is powerful prose – fully deserving a 5-star rating."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"It may not be the best book ever written,  but it will stay with one a long time.",4.0,"First Sentence:  Marsh is not swamp.Kya Clark, aka Marsh Girl, virtually raised herself.  Her ability to watch and learn, and to depend on her North Carolina marsh allowed her to survive. When the handsome son of a prominent family is found dead, Kya is accused of his murder.  But was it an accident? Did she kill him?  Only with the help of others might Kya survive this, too.An author who paints pictures with words is one to be savored.  Owens does just that and does it beautifully.  There is a strong, lyrical quality to the writing—""Kya laid her hand upon the breathing, wet earth, and the marsh became her mother.""The author does employ devices one may find annoying: multiple POVs and time fluctuations. Give it a chance, however. Before long, one may find oneself thoroughly captivated and willing to overlook those things.  Instead, one becomes immersed in a wonderful story filled with interesting characters, a setting which engages all the senses and emotions, and a desire for some real Southern cooking—""The aroma of sausage and biscuits, boiled turnip greens, and fried chicken thankfully overtook the high smell of fish barrels lining the dock. … Behind the counter, owner-cook Jim Bo Sweeny darted from flipping crab cakes on the griddle to stirring a pot of creamed corn on the burner to poking chicken thighs in the deep fryer…""Owens' descriptions are magnetic. She knows how to engage the reader—""There are some who can live without wild things, and some who cannot.""  It is not all description.  The author creates interesting, strong secondary characters, including Jumpin', his wife Mabel, and particularly Tate—""His dad had told him many times that the definition of a real man is one who cries without shame, reads poetry with his heart, feels opera in his soul, and does what's necessary to defend a woman."" One also learns the meaning of the title, and celebrate Kya's successes—""I wadn't aware that words could hold so much.  I didn't know a sentence could be so full.""  Wouldn't one love to remember when one had made that discovery?Although there is a slight sense of fantasy about the plot, one can't help but be entranced by Kya's strength, courage, and perseverance—""I have to do life alone.  But I knew this.""  But it's not all misty light.  Owen's takes us into Kya's feelings of being confined and through the trial, which was well done.The book isn't perfect.  The actions of one character don't always ring true and one may start to feel a bit manipulated. However, there is no question but that one's emotions become completely engaged to the point of possibly shedding tears at the finale; not a sad cry, but a lovely-ending cry.""Where the Crawdads Sing"" is a very good book.  It may not be the best book ever written or that one has ever read, but it is one of those rare books which will stay with one a long time. It will be interesting to see what Owen's writes next.WHERE THE CRAWDAD SINGS (Myst/Novel-Kya-North Carolina-Contemp) – VG Owens, Delia – 1st book G.P. Putnam's Sons – Aug 2018"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Lyrical Narrative,3.0,"A gentle coming-of-age story and a murder-mystery, set along the coastal region of North Carolina – a vast area of marsh teeming with insects and birdlife. The youngest child of an abusive marriage, Kya finds herself abandoned in the family home, a place which amounts to nothing much more than a primitive shack in the marshlands. She spends her time studying and documenting the wildlife, finding great solace in her environment. Her survival depends on collecting oysters and catching and smoking fish to sell to the local village store, in return for boat fuel and other supplies. She soon meets Tate, and they form a teenage kinship. Although he teaches her to read and their relationship looks set to blossom, Tate moves away to further his education, but breaks his promise to return. Chase, the handsome sporting hero about town wastes no time in pursuing the now mature, beautiful, and elusive Marsh Girl. Kya eventually falls for his superficial charms, until the day Chase reveals his true character and she’s forced to retaliate. Meanwhile, Tate has sourced a publisher interested in Kya’s detailed documentation of the flora and fauna of the marsh. While she’s on a very rare trip out of town meeting her publisher, Chase is discovered dead and the town points its many fingers at the secretive, semi-feral Marsh Girl.The first half of the book, describing Kya’s early years alone, I found a little tedious and repetitive: I’m not sure I completely swallow the fact that a girl at the tender age of seven finds the wherewithal to live quite as independently as Kya did, and that no one in the town sought to discover the truth about her living conditions and the absence of her family. And the dynamics of the murder reveal and the denouement, didn’t quite work for me. The strength of this novel lies in the lyrical narrative, which is rich in ecology, analogies, and the details of swamp life, all of which are expressed with a deft hand. It’s a unique setting, and the author uses clever comparisons of animal behaviours to add depth of character and explain motivation. I did enjoy the book, I just didn’t love it."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Beautifully written, captivating book",5.0,"This is an enchanting but sad story.It is the story of Kya, the Marsh Girl, abandoned by her mother at an early age.Ma leaves in order to escape an abusive husband. Kya and her much elder siblings are left behind. Subsequently, the siblings leave too, including Jodie, her favourite brother.Pa is an unsympathetic character, who neglects Kya completely. She is often starving until she learns how to get hold of and sell some products.Kya can 't read or count. She only lasts one day at school, it being too hurtful to go there and be treated like “swamp trash”.For me, one of the saddest things is that since Kya doesn't attend school, she doesn't learn to read. But then she makes a wonderful friend, Tate, who comes to her shack and teaches her how to.By that time Pa has deserted her too, or else he is dead, she doesn 't know.Tate is a good friend until he too abandons her. She is all alone. But the kindly black man, Jumpin' and his wife Mabel help Kya out and give her clothing.Kya collects shells and feathers and becomes an expert on the Marsh.Tate brings her presents of feathers. He is becoming an expert too.Occasionally, we jump forward in time and learn about the case of Chase Andrews, whose body is found in mysterious circumstances at the foot of a Tower and police are investigating what happened. Kya knows Chase too.This is a beautifully written book about a lonely, sensitive, gifted girl. I highly recommend that you read it."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Mills and Boon bought up to date,1.0,"I acknowledge that I am out of step with most people who love this book and rate it 5* .  The story is one of Catherine ( called Kya)  abandoned by her mother , her siblings then her feckless father in the marsh and swampland of North Carolina and on the edge of a nearby town.  We are asked to suspend credulity; at the age of ten she is living completely on her own , surviving by collecting muscles and selling them to Jumpin at his Gas and Bait shop. Interspersed with her story is the investigation in current time of the apparent murder of a local man. Kya not only survives but thrives growing up to be slim and beautiful - quite startling that she has no health problems given that she seems to survive on Grits and fish! Two men enter her life. Tate, a teenager, teaches her to read and of course she becomes fluent - so fluent that within 6 months she manages to read 'Rebecca' though we are not told what she made of the tangled lives of Max de Winter and his wives.  Kya is soon borrowing books from a public library  and within a couple of years is mastering 'The principals or organic chemistry' and 'fundamentals of ecology' and musing on Einstein. Before long she is publishing books on marsh ecology. Tate goes away to college and a local man (Chase) enters the picture. He seduces her but of course it is clear all along he was never going to marry her. When he is found dead suspicion lands on Kya .  The plot is thin and reminiscent of the Mills and Boon books my mother used to read in the 1950s.  Clichés abound, the character are two dimensional stereotypes and the language wooden. The sex scenes and poetry are trite . I did finish it just to see if my thoughts re the so called murder were correct. They were. I wish I had not wasted my time"
Where the Crawdads Sing,An interesting story,4.0,"I have to say that the expectations for this book were pretty high from the beginning. Not only that the majority of this virtual book community loved it (or at least their reviews said so), but my best book buddies also gave it all the possible stars. The beginning was pretty hard, with all the words describing the marsh and the animal and biological species inhabiting it, but once the story went on, I got pretty hooked up on it. This is an astonishing story of a brave young six year old girl, left alone in the most uncommon place, the tiny shack in the middle of the marsh, with nothing but her own instincts and brains to help her survive. It is the story of living in fear but also in sync with the nature, coping with loneliness and betrayal, searching for love and giving second chances. What the author did the best was describing Kya's need for love and her inner fights between staying independent and strong, and falling for someone, giving herself and trusting another person. We follow her through her search for acceptance, her two big relationships, her growth and her heartbreaks. But one day she gets accused of a murder. And then it all goes downhill. The perfect surroundings and nature get replaced by the cold and life free cell, and the story of her interesting life gets transferred into all court drama. If only that part was a bit shorter, I'm sure I would enjoy the book a bit more. Nonetheless, the ending gets it right in every possible way, (so be sure to stick to it).What I loved the most was the character of The Marsh girl - sometimes stubborn, sometimes to hard on herself, but intelligent, strong, observant, sensitive and always in search for knowledge and understanding. Maybe its just me or the time I was reading this book, but even though I loved the main characters Kya and Tate, their love story which was so romantic and unspoiled, I just couldn't get all the emotions I felt I needed. I wanted to care for them, I wanted to root for them, I wanted to cry for Kya's unfortunate life. But, it just didn't happen. Hence, that's why the 4 stars for me. I will still definitely recommend this book to my friends, because of a great story, interesting plot and a breeze of a fresh air that this book gives us, taking us all to the wild parts of the marsh."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A book that reads like poetry,5.0,"What a beautiful book.  This is the story of the survival of a child through the abandonment of her family to being brought up by the wilderness itself into the most amazing woman.  Kya is a wonderful character who we get to know through her life, as her mother, then her siblings abandon her to lead a lonely life in her wilderness home.  At first she is left with her father who eventually gives in to his alcoholic, gambling interests.  We know that she is safer with him gone, providing she finds a way to bring in a small amount of money to feed herself, having no other bills as she has no gas, electricity or water to pay for as her shack is without any utilities whatsoever.She starts selling mussels to the local shop owner for cash, while his wife provides Kya with clothes from her church as she grows and develops.  Kya is made to attend school one day, but the traumatic experience of being bullied by the other children leaves her determined never to return.  She hides out in her home surroundings so well that the truant officers give up chasing her, leaving her alone and without any help or support.The descriptions throughout the book are almost poetically perfect.  Whilst reading, the reader can’t help but imagine the surroundings like a painting, hear the birds sing and smell the rotting scrubland.  She is a determined child and she teaches herself to cook after watching her mother, clean the house and do the laundry also after watching and copying.  Likewise she teaches herself to sail the boat left by her father and this enables her to flourish in the life she makes for herself.However, she is frustrated by not knowing what comes after 29.  Luckily she becomes reacquainted with Tate, a boy older than her who offers to teach her how to read, and count.  We find out that Kya is a talented young girl who absorbs all she is taught like a sponge.  She learns all about the flora and fauna of her surroundings, delighting in learning and classifying her world.  Unfortunately when Tate starts university he becomes yet another person who abandons her as he believes that Kya wouldn’t fit in with the world he now inhabits.Unfortunately for Kya, the next person who comes into her life is not interested in including her in his life, as he keeps her a secret from his family while they spend time together alone.  After seeing each other for almost a year, Chase talks about marriage, raising hopes in Kya of being introduced into the society outside of her shack.  This is all a lie as he becomes engaged to another girl while seeing Kya.  Their relationship ends as he becomes yet another person who has abandoned Kya.Tate seeks out Kya as he becomes aware of how she is being treated.  However, Kya’s heart is now hardened and she refuses to let Tate back into her life as she can no longer trust him.  After seeing her sketches and detailed notes of her surroundings on the walls of her shack, he suggests he takes some with him as he might be able to get someone interested in her work.  This is successful and Kya gets an offer to write a book which will include her illustrations and observations of life in the marshland.Kya gets more money than she has ever known for her book, which becomes the first of many.  Kya is now able to get services into her shack, including her first toilet. Things are definitely looking up when Kya is sexually attacked by Chase.  She fights back and leaves him in pain after a failed attempt at raping her.  Kya May be naive, but she knows that men like Chase do not like being beaten in such situations and she knows she will be forever looking behind her.The same weekend that she is away meeting her publisher, Chase is found dead.  This leads on to a court case when Kya is accused of his murder.The conclusion of this book is brilliant.  Not wanting to give away any spoilers there are more surprises in store for the reader.  The book reads like a longer book, there are no spare words.  On finishing this book, I felt sad that it was over, with no hope of a sequel.  It’s a lovely experience reading this book.  I know many people have loved it.  If you haven’t read it yet, please do."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A solid thriller!,4.0,"Thank you so so much @hachettebooks for a #gifted copy of Where The Crawdads Sing!What I have with this book is a love/hate relationship I kind of ship!I was so overly excited when I received this book that I started it straight away just to leave it aside for a whole month after just 40 pages!!I couldn't get into it. The writing style, the vocabulary used and the story itself made me think that, although this book it is a lot of people's favourite, maybe it wasn't for me.But many people kept telling me that the book gets better, that the story picks up and so I thought: Right! Let's do it!And so I ended up enjoying this book and liking it very very much!People were right when they said that the story gets better and after 50-60 pages in, things started to happen, events started to take place and I couldn't put this book down!I loved Kya, the main character. I loved how strong she is despite the life she has had, and I loved her character, how she dealt with everything and everyone.I also liked the romance story. I didn't expect it and although I am a big thriller fan, I am starting to read some more romances and this one in particular was a very good one!I enjoyed the murder investigation chapters very much. I enjoyed the whole journey from when they find the body until they discover what really happened.The last third of the book was my favorite part without a doubt. I really enjoyed the trial part. It was very well done, interesting and intriguing. The perfect end for this book!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Breathtaking and Beautiful,5.0,"There is a moment where Kya, the main character, on reading her first book says 'I wadna aware that words could hold so much. I didn't know a sentence could be so full'. This is a perfect metaphor for this beautiful novel.In late 1969, perfect American boy Chase Andrews is found dead and suspicion quickly falls on Kya Clark, the 'Marsh Girl'. Throughout the novel we follow the timeline of Kya's life as first her mother, then the rest of her family abandon her, leaving her to live alone on the marsh. The narrative is juxtaposed with the build up to and subsequent trial of Kya for Chase's murder.The novel has echoes of 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. We witness prejudice, small town politics, hope and good people. At the heart of the novel is Kya and her story is achingly beautiful.As her family departs, Kya's teacher becomes the Marsh surrounding her. It becomes as much a character as Kya herself, the descriptions and love that Kya has for her home are simply wonderful. She takes her moral compass from the wildlife surrounding her, life lessons from the landscape and grasses and passions from the sea and tides. The marsh is home, a sanctuary providing a much needed escape for Kya. As the first line read by Kya says 'There are some who can live without wild things and some who cannot'.I have truly adored this novel and since finishing it keep dipping back in to read favourite chapters. The Marsh is as strong a character as Kya and Delia Owen's writing makes it a guiding hand to her. Despite the prejudice that exists amongst the townspeople, there is also good - Tate, his father, Jumpin' and Mabel. By and far the most engaging part of the novel is Kya herself. Strong, determined and proof that your background does not define who you are. This is a testament to the human spirit and a love letter to the Marshes. Breathtaking and beautiful."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Something Different,5.0,"Delia Owens is not an Author that I had heard of before.""Where The Crawdads Sing"" is quite intriguing and really is something different.  The story covers so many aspects of life and in particular early experiences at home (being let down and abused). 'Marsh Girl' Kya Clark amazed everyone by her accomplishments. Just because she was different from what local people classified, she was constantly criticised. The general consensus was 'when in doubt, think badly of her. We travel with Kya through her struggles, her heart breaks and her success. There are many twists and turns making this debut novel and absolute page-turner.This story wold translate very well into the small screen for a short series."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Five stars is not enough!,5.0,"THIS BOOK HAS GONE IN MY TOP 10 BOOKS OF ALL TIME! Just to put that into perspective, I have read well over 1,000 books and I haven't had a book go into my top 10 for about 8 years. That's how much I love Where the Crawdads Sing.This book enchanted, mesmerised and enraptured me. Kya, the Marsh Girl, took my heart and held it firmly in her grasp until the end of the book and beyond. It is about survival, loneliness and prejudice but so much more than that: it's about nature and wildlife and the elements.The prose is lyrical and lush and wrapped me up in a huge embrace. I lived alongside Kya with the birds and the deer, I rode in her old boat through the marshes with her, I raced down to her piece of the beach with her to feed the gulls. I wanted to eat this book up in one gulp, but I was afraid of finishing it and leaving them behind and so I read it slowly and savoured every sentence.To say I have a book hangover now I am finished is an understatement. I want to go back to page one and start all over again. I envy those of you who have yet to read Where the Crawdads Sing. What a treat you have in store. If you have read this book, other I can recommend that gave me the same feels are Witch Light by and Wolf Totem by Jiang Rong, The Snow Child by to name a few."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Wonderful modern classic!,5.0,"This is a coming of age story with a difference and it is so beautifully written that I think it would be difficult not to be drawn in by its compelling plot.Kya grows up in the marshes living alone in a shack. Abandoned by her mother at 7 years old and left with her abusive alcoholic father, Kya learns to look after herself and rely on no one.  When her father disappears too she is truly alone.The locals call her the marsh girl and she is teased on her one and only day at school so refuses to return. She finally  learns to read and write when Tate, a friend of her beloved but absent brother Jodie befriends her and teaches her. She gradually falls in love with Tate and starts to trust that he cares for her  but he too leaves her to go to college and she is destined to be alone again.She is attracted to local bad boy Chase Andrews and they then start a relationship but it is clear from the start that he does not have her interests at heart and only cares about himself.However the book is written in two timelines- the 1950s as Kya grows up and 1969 when Chase Andrews is found dead, having fallen from a tower. Kya is accused of his murder and the second part of the book focusses on the investigation and subsequent trial.The book is very descriptive with wonderful passages describing the marsh and the wild animals and birds that live there. It is well written but also quite a compelling read which I couldn’t put down.I loved the character of Kya, how she managed to survive alone, abandoned by her whole family but desparate for human contact. Her relationship with Tate was beautiful and heartbreaking.Jumpin, the black garage owner who sells her fuel for her boat is also a great character. Gradually, over the years he begins to look at her like a daughter and help her as much as he can. Kya is an outsider because of her lifestyle and so is he because of his colour although he has family that care about him unlike Kya.Set in the Deep South of America, it certainly had the feel of a modern  day classic  and in parts  reminded me of ‘To Kill A Mockingbird’It is  a truly excellent debut by this author and I will definitely be looking out for more books by Delia Owens.Thanks to NetGalley and the publishers for my arc in exchange for an honest review."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Amazing read,4.0,"Kya has been abandoned by all her family and finds solace only when in the marsh surrounded by her wild animals and nature. Until two boys come in her life and in her heart new feelings erupt.Delia Owens has a beautiful way of describing nature and surroundings and for sure that’s the reflections on her expertise on nature and animals, as she is a zoologist.I was completely amazed by the way Kya’s behaviour and life was inspired by the marsh and loved her from the first pages, I don’t think in her shoes I could have survived what she had. Tate, Mabel and Jumpin as well were characters which I’ve really appreciated throughout the book and had enough depths to them, so I could completely relate to, even tho the story wasn’t fully focused on them.However I didn’t feel Where the crawdads sing didn’t deserve 5*, cause I would have preferred to have included in the book a recounting of the night in which Chase died. How did it happen? I think that would have connected all the Ford in the story.But overall an amazing read!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,The jury knew better than the author!,4.0,"Reading the many reviews of this novel it is clear most readers love it but a few loathe it. I am somewhere in between, but certainly more positive that negative. I found the basic story-line about an abandoned girl growing up largely on her own in the marshes of North Carolina intriguing (though it does strain credulity that she never suffers significant illness). The descriptions of nature in the marshland is compelling and the accounts of her fumbling relationships with the two young men who take an interest in her make sense in a strange sort of way. But the way this is all interwoven with a crime whodunnit is problematic. We feel for Kya because she is the victim of prejudice, are pleased that the jury overcome their prejudice to declare her innocent, and then we discover at the end that she did, after all, kill Chase. A clever twist, you might think. But the circumstances in which she could have committed and hidden the crime are so unlikely that my instinct is to think, no she couldn't have done. The jury knew better than the author!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautifully written,4.0,"This book kept popping up on so many must read lists that I felt a compulsion to read it. Kya Clark is known as the Marsh girl and for years has been picked on by the locals because she is different. She was abandoned by her family when she was six and rather than risk been taken into care decided to fend for herself. Kya strange life style makes fascinating reading and as the story progresses she grows up into a beautiful young woman. It is plain to see why she is attracting two men in her life, Tate and Chase. Chase is a bad boy and although he is already seeing a few other local girls he now has his sights on Kya. The other man in her life Tate is the complete opposite to Chase but shares the common aim of winning Kya's attention. But in late 1969 everything changes when Chase Andrews is found dead and the locals automatically suspect Kya.The more I read of this novel the more I enjoyed it, for me it started slow but I think that was more down to the complete change in reading genre. Beautifully written and it is easy to see why the novel gets so many plaudits."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"A haunting, beautifully written chronicle of an extraordinary life",5.0,"It is as difficult to classify this book in terms of genre as it is to describe Kya, its amazing protagonist. The book is part mystery, part legal thriller and part coming-of-age chronicle, blended with a eulogy for the wonders of the natural world, as epitomised by the North Carolina marshlands.Kya Clark herself is an alluring enigma. Youngest of five children of the poverty-stricken Clark family, who dwell in a rough-hewn shack in marshlands near the North Carolina coast, her life seems set to be one of despair and neglect. The novel opens with Kya, then still very young, hearing the door opening and then seeing her mother, dressed in her finest clothes, walking up the rough driveway towards what passes for the main road. Kya never sees her mother again. Oppressed by their father’s rage and violence, her elder siblings all drift away, leaving Kya alone with her father. Somehow they manage to struggle by, and her father’s drinking and rage seem gradually to improve, although before very long he too simply goes and never returns. His disappearance is never properly explained, and Kya is left alone, her age barely into double figures, to fend for herself. This she manages admirably, demonstrating a level of amazing resourcefulness.Having been biorn and raised in the marshlands, Kya soon finds her way around, and carves a life out for herself. At one stage the authorities eem to have caught up with her, and the local Truant Officer drags her to school. She stays there for just one day, during which her separateness from the other children is rendered unbridgeably vast. She never returns, and the inhabitants of the nearby small town largely forget about her, although stories circulate about ‘the Marsh Girl’I should stress that despite the fairly dramatic, even traumatic, incidents I have cited above, this book does not fall into the category of ‘misery saga’ that seemed so popular a few years ago. Kya’s upbringing is hard, but it is also a story that resounds with hope.At different times, she encounters and befriends two young men from the town. Chase Andrews is wealthy, handsome and seems to have it all, which has left him spoilt, and entirely unused to having his wishes denied. The other boy is Tate, who is clearty entranced by Kya’s beauty, and who perseveres to break down her shyness and wariness with townspeople, eventually becoming her closest friend and teaching her to read. He will eventually leave town to go to college, where he wants to study marine biology. In the meantime, he has taught Kya all he knows, and she develops her own extreme expertise in that area of study.The novel consists of two parallel narratives. The first starts in the early 1950s and follows Kya’s life, a story that is interspersed with incidents starting in 1969, when the body of one of the townspeople is discovered in suspicious circumstances, which prompts a murder investigation.It is beautifully written. Delia Owens clearly has her own finely-developed insights into the flora and fauna of the marshlands, and a clear understanding of the fragility of the marsh ecosystem, and the beauty of its inhabitants, and this is conveyed throughout. Kya is a fascinating character: beautiful, independent and ultimately resourceful, seemingly capable of circumventing all the adversities (and there are lots of adversities!) that are thrown her way. The prose is simple but beguiling.The book is not flawless, and I wonder if the writer might have found herself struggling up against her deadlines. It seemed to end very suddenly. I also found that Kya went from being taught how to read at all to working her way through complex biological texts within the shortest of intervals. These are, however, very minor, almost petulant, cavils, and the book hung together wonderfully.Perhaps it is too early to start thinking about the best novel I have read this year, but this is definitely a long way ahead of any competitors at the moment."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Poignant tale of loneliness and survival,4.0,"Where the Crawdads Sing was recommended by a friend, who said the writing was beautiful. She wasn't wrong. It's a story of grinding poverty, neglect and abuse among the 'marsh people' in 1950s and 60s North Carolina. The central character is Kya, abandoned by her whole family before she is even into double figures, and left to fend for herself in a rundown marsh shack. The animals and birds become her family, and though she doesn't go to school, a friend of her brother teaches her to read and write. He brings her books and encourages her to document the 'treasures' she finds in the marsh. There is a love story here too, and a murder (maybe?) but the narrative interweaves seamlessly. I would have given it 5 stars but for the frequent insertion of poetry, which jarred a little. Overall, it's a story about hope, and the importance of allowing love into our hearts, however wounded they may be."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Brilliant,5.0,"This one grew on me as you follow Kya right from a little 7 year old and abandoned by all her family into adulthood. The neglect and loneliness that Kya experiences as a child and teenager is just heartbreaking. And this loneliness continues as she grows and develops relationships with Tate and Chase and spreads her wings out into her little town. The prejudice experienced by Kya is just awful and you can see why she relates to Jumpin and his wife Mabel (the black couple who run the local shop). I really liked how Owens describes the the marsh and its inhabitants - very much a character in its own right and simply beautiful. She also did a great job of making me connect and feel for Kya, given the rather unusual situation (both in childhood and adulthood). I must admit, I did see the big reveal coming, but not it’s delivery. A great read and Campbell does a great job as narrator."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautifully Original,5.0,"So many people recommended this book to me that I was reluctant to read it in case it didn’t live up to the hype. It did!The story of Kya, abandoned by her family and doing her best to survive alone in the wild marshlands was beautifully written. I know nothing about the world Kya lives in, but the author painted such a detailed picture with words that I could visualise the landscape, the birds, the insects, the plants and the people. The use of colloquial language and dialects for the dialogue added another layer of authenticity to the story. The way that different poems were interweaved throughout the story added yet another dimension to the imagery the author created.Kya’s character is vulnerable but strong; her resilience, her love of her environment and its wildlife, her passion for learning despite being illiterate, and her issues with relationships and abandonment meant that I was rooting for her from the very beginning. I experienced every emotion alongside her and often found myself holding my breath in anticipation as situations unfolded.I thought I’d guessed the ending, then changed my mind and wasn’t disappointed when the truth was revealed. The final poem was perfect."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A beautiful and well written story,5.0,"I have just finished this book and simply can't understand some of the negative reviews I've read.  I'm so glad I ignored them and believed the majority and read it for myself.  I won't regale the tale again.  So many people have already done so, needless to say I it was an easy for me to award 5 stars to this superb novel.  I found the writing just so evocative of life in the deep south.  The descriptions of the wildlife, swamps and marshes, the weather and the feelings it inspired in Kya are just wonderful.  My favourite character was Jumpin' and his wife Mabel who cared for Kya, identifying that she faced as much discrimination as they did.  I know people would say they're a bit of a cliche, but for me, they demonstrate the warmth and generosity that would have been a reality amongst the black community of the time. The characterisations of Kya and many of the major players in this novel were so well written that they were utterly believable.  I'm sure that many children, like Kya and her family, faced a life of poverty, suffering the violence of an abusive husband and father and perhaps, still do so today.  I found the journey through the pages often emotional, peppered with frustrations at the prejudice aimed at the Marsh Girl and the affect it had on her.  Ignore those terrible reviews, read it for yourself.  I loved this novel and thoroughly recommend it!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautiful and inspiring,5.0,"Wow. That’s really all I can say right now. The praise that has been heaped on Owens’ book is extremely deserved. It’s so different from other books of its type.The use of the split timeline is inspired. We start the 1969 timeline with the discovery of Chases’ body and the other timeline goes back to 1952 to show Kya growing up and explains why she is the way she is. I absolutely loved this. The earlier timeline enabled me to get to know and understand Kya a little more whilst the later timeline was laying out the evidence and eventually the trial.Kya’s story was heartbreaking at times but also incredibly inspirational. The characterisation was beautiful and the ways she dealt with the, at times, overwhelming levels of adversity was truly inspiring.I hadn’t read much about the plot of this before starting it, apart from the synopsis on the back, so I don’t really know what I was expecting but it blew me away. The writing is exquisite with the flow drawing me in and keeping me there. Every time I picked this up I’d be desperate to read more.Without giving away any spoilers, the ending was absolutely perfect to me but at times it was a rocky road getting there. Parts of the trial had me so angry and I just wanted to reach into the book and help Kya.The way the narrative is split across the two timelines made it different to a lot of other books of this type and I think helped me to understand Kya and how she had ended up in this situation. She is a character I warmed to instantly and you go through a lot with her during the course of the book, suffering her lows and celebrating her highs. I feel like this is one I’m going to be thinking about for a long time after it’s done and would definitely recommend it if there is anyone out there who still hasn’t read it!What a great start to 2020!! I couldn’t fault this at all."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Not worth the rave reviews,2.0,"Completely unrealistic and implausible plot. The characters, including the protagonist, have no depth. And don’t tell me that her being an innocent hermitic ‘marsh girl’ is an excuse for poor, superficial characterisation. I think the author intended to present a character with an almost primitive mindset that we more ‘civilised’ and urbanised folk aren’t meant to fully understand, but there was too much that didn’t make sense because the characterisation was so poor. The most anaemic of the characters was her love interest. He was really pathetic, all the way through the story. That alone was off-putting. My friend loved it. I didn’t. The ending, the most interesting part of the story, sadly doesn’t do enough to explain or justify the nonsensical plot. I just didn’t buy it. This author should stick to nature writing - which she does beautifully- not writing novels."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A Little Disappointed,3.0,"(CONTAINS SPOILERS) I was excited to purchase this book because of the hype surrounding it. Firstly, I adored the descriptive and poetic narrative of the marsh (hence the 3 stars) - I really felt like I was there and that I was able to share Kya's love for it all. However, I felt the characters lacked depth and throughout the book there were many scenes that were almost rushed and glossed over with a few sentences. Perhaps this was the author's intention to kind of make the reader feel separate from what was going on as Kya would have felt. However, it was still quite frustrating and left me feeling disappointed.Secondly, the ending was also a let down for me. I mean, the court case (which I also felt was rushed and lacked depth) pretty much proved she hadn't done it, but as a twist she had done it after all?! Whaaaat?! This makes no sense. If she had done it, that was extremely calculated, out of character and nigh-on impossible with the bus timings! It just felt like a convenient plot twist that the author threw in for good measure but didn't quite work. I have a horrible feeling they're going to make this into a cheesy, slightly boring film at some point..."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Amazing Read,5.0,"This is an incredibly beautiful novel from Delia Owens, totally immersive, an ode to the natural environment and the marshes in particular. Catherine Danielle Clark, aka Kya, is 6 years old when her mother leaves their shack in the remote wilderness of the North Carolina coastal marshes, next to the town of Barkley Cove. Her family is desperately poor, and before long her siblings follow suit, abandoning her to the care of her alcoholic, neglectful and abusive father, and at 14 years old, he too leaves her for good. Completely isolated, school proves to be a tortuous experience, she stays for only one day, avoiding all attempts by the truant officer and others to bring her back. Kya is the Wild Child, The Marsh Girl, Marsh Trash as far as the residents of Barkley Cove are concerned, directing hate, ridicule, contempt and hurtful prejudice at the bewildered Kya, as she becomes the target of harrassment and attacks, the community dehumanising and shunning her. No-one other than the black Jumpin and his wife, Mabel, offer help or advice to the lonely girl, and they face a barrage of racist attacks and humiliation themselves.Unable to read and write, longing for the return of her mother, Kya desperately desires company, and to belong. For a while, she receives some sustenance in the form of Tate, who looks out for her, teaches her to read and write, and shares Kya's joy in the marsh world with its insects, wildlife, birds, weather and her untethered hold it has on her, collecting ever rare feathers and shells. A close relationship develops between the two of them until he leaves to study marine biology at university. Tate leaving has the effect of chipping away at Kya's inner capacity to trust as she once again finds herself isolated, but her curiosity about the marshes, and her ability to paint all that resides within it, has her pursuing a deeper and more academic knowledge of it. However, she still wants to belong and her burgeoning sexuality and hopes for marriage and family are met with betrayal, treachery and worse. In a narrative that goes back and forth in time from the 1950s to the present of 1969 onwards, where the favoured son of Barkley Cove, the golden boy Chase Andrews is discovered dead by two boys, having fallen from a tower. There is no evidence of murder, but the Sheriff is uneasy, and Andrews’s mother and the town are bursting with rumours of murder so a trial ensues.Owen has written a captivating and mesmerising novel, unforgettable in its vibrant descriptions of the marsh location and the life within it. Juxtaposed with that is the small town of Barkley Cove, indifferent at best, malicious and dangerous at its worst, with none of the spirit of compassion to support a young child forced to find ways to financially survive, emotionally bereft, finding comfort in poetry that lends weight to her inner feelings. Despite all the horrors and struggles she faces, she makes something of herself, something which Barkley Cove refuses to acknowledge. Her profound sensitivity to nature, which proves to be the ultimate educator, shapes Kya's perception of the human behaviour she encounters. The marsh is where she belongs, it and all that it entails is home, everyone else has left her, leaving her exposed and vulnerable when she begins to feel fear. It is barely surprising that when elements of her life begin to shift that she would be wary and distrusting, although buried parts of her harbour tiny sparks of hope. This is simply superb storytelling that winds it way into your heart as I rooted for Kya amidst the barrage of turbulence and heartbreak she endures. Amazing read. Many thanks to Little, Brown for an ARC."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Very average book,3.0,"This is a story about a young girl, Kya, who grows up living amongst the marshes of North Carolina. We are introduced to her from a young age, where we see her being left to fend for herself as her mother abandons the marsh shack she and her family live in, and when finally it is only she and her father, who disappears for days at time drinking and gambling, then he too eventually one day leaves and does not return either. Being left in this way we see a young girl learning how to survive and become resilient to life, learning how to sail the rivers and estuaries around the marshland, and collect mussels which to sell as her only means of money to buy such basics to eat. The novel is set across 1950 - 1970, at time where communities carried such prejudices against people like Kya, and name her the 'Marsh girl'. As Kya learns to become resilient against the community of Barkley Cove, we see how she begins to learn how to live as part of the marsh, by feeding birds and getting to know particular animals behaviour and the different flowers and fauna which grow there, often having no-one to share her thoughts and feelings with but the wildlife around her. Childhood friend Tate then teaches her to read and loans her many books on the ecological systems of the marshes, where she begins to develop and deepen her knowledge and passion of the wildlife she lives in, to the point where years on she makes money by writing and illustrating books on this subject matter. The book also sees Kya deal with the issue of loss; having lost her family over the years as they all gradually abandoned the family home, and then her childhood friend and first love Tate leaves her, and then she is later deceived by Chase, another member of the local community who she forms a relationship with. We see Kya make parallels between her life and how creatures, such as bullfrogs, behave with one another, males luring females to mate and then how they move from one partner to another in a deceptive way. She makes comparisons between this and her own life and how she feels she has been let down, in particular by male relationships in her life. As her ability to read improves she also discovers poetry her mother left behind, and begins to develop a love for this, again making comparisons to particular lines in poetry to the life in which she is living. The book jumps back and forwards in time, where we see Kya grow up over the years starting back in the 1950's, but forward to 1969 where the body of Chase is discovered dead. The chapters show an unfolding of events between the two times, which finally culminates in 1970 where Kya is on trial for the murder of Chase. Whilst I found this whole story in the main well written, there were parts which I felt relied on a simple narrative of events. The story itself I felt was quite simple, to the point of being somewhat predictable at times, which for me was what let the overall book down, not really drawing me in fully with any twists or having a desire to know what happens next. It was an easy text to read, and being set in the marshes, the natural setting and ecology referenced in the book made an interesting read as well as the pieces of poetry entwined in the text, however, this is no more than an average book for me."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Compelling and addictive -,5.0,"This book is a combination of history, nature and humanity. When those three things combine in a novel, it’s nearly always beautiful – and this book is no exception.Like quite a few people, I wasn’t sure about how I was going to feel about this book. I was actually given it in April this year for my 30th Birthday and until July I didn’t feel ready to read it. But after I had a few more University essays behind me – and a lovely visit from friends in North Carolina to prompt me to read a bit more about its history – I got stuck in.  “She knew the years of isolation had altered her behavior until she was different from others, but it wasn’t her fault she’d been alone. Most of what she knew, she’d learned from the wild. Nature had nurtured, tutored, and protected her when no one else would.”I couldn’t stop reading it. Granted, the first few chapters were tricky and I wasn’t sure which direction the book was going in. But that’s the best part about books – the ones that surprise you are often the best. The ones that hook you in halfway through and completely turn around your opinion…they’re even better.It’s the 1950s when we first meet Kya and learn about the bulk of her upbringing. She’s young, her mother has just walked away from the family home, and with her Kya’s siblings slowly disappear into the marsh as well. Kya brushes along with her alcoholic Father for a few years – dodging the school system, sheltering from the shrewd opinions of the locals – until she’s alone in the marsh, fending for herself. The book is written in two parts – and I feel that part one definitely focuses on the beauty of the marsh (as well as the challenges) and part two pinpoints the darkness of the swamp.  “Sand keeps secrets better than mud.”Delia Owens is already the co-author of three non-fiction books about her life as a wildlife scientist in Africa. This is her debut novel – and it has taken the world by storm. Perhaps most fascinating for me was when I started to dig into Owens history – I always do that when a debut novel strikes a chord. I almost can’t quite believe it’s the authors first foray into fiction world! So it probably isn’t surprising to learn that Delia herself and her ex-husband were at the centre of an investigation into the killing of a poacher many years ago. Delia’s true life and the life of Kya in the book run parallel on more than one occasion. Delia spent much of her adult life (over twenty three years) in partial or extreme isolation due to her work.  “I wasn’t aware that words could hold so much. I didn’t know a sentence could be so full.”Now that University is coming to an end I’ve allowed myself the luxury of joining a few more reading groups on Facebook. I’ve noticed that quite often people post a photograph of a book and say something like, ‘What do people think of this…so and so said it’s awful so I’m not sure whether to give it a go…’ Sometimes, they’re books that are at the top of the top of the charts. I’ve seen it written a few times about this book – and I can assure you, it’s worth giving it a go and more… It was liked enough that Reese Witherspoon is looking into producing it for the big screen…Amazon have recently announced that it’s held their number one spot for longer than any other book.  “Owens reminds us that we are forever shaped by the children we once were, and that we are all subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps.”This book delivers a massive punch – right at the end. I saw it coming but from the reviews I’ve read there have been mixed surprise. Secrets are unearthed as the book progresses and despite the culmination in the story at the end – Delia Owens reaches this conclusion with a gentle hand and easy writing. One of the biggest questions at the end of this book was… Do Crawdad’s really sing? Well Delia Owens has an answer for that…  “Technically, scientifically, crawdads do not sing. But I’ve made a bit of a study of it myself. And I’ve found that first you must go— all by yourself—and set up a small camp in real wilderness. I’m speaking of a place far from any road or village. Not a park, but a remote and wild land filled with Earth’s creatures. Just before dusk, you must walk deep into the woods and stand there exposed and totally alone as darkness descends around you. When you can feel the planet beneath your toes and the trees moving about, you must listen with all your ears, and—I promise—you will hear the crawdads sing. In fact, it will be a chorus. ” – Book Browse"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Wonderful,5.0,"I’m always dubious when a book has been hyped up so much and worry that I’ll be in the minority of people who don’t like it. I really didn’t have to worry this time, Where The Crawdads Sing went well beyond my expectations and I loved it.Kya is a character that you will instantly take to your heart, starting off as a young girl living at home in the marsh with her parents and brother Jodie we follow Kya as she grows up and is left to fend for herself. I adored reading about Kya although I felt heart-broken at times and just wanted to sweep her off the pages and protect her. I think everyone, no matter what age could learn a lesson from Kya, she has it tough but boy is she a tough little cookie.Along the way Kya meets some wonderful characters who include Tate, Jumpin and Mabel, each one helps Kya in a certain way but like with any town or village there are those that think they are above themselves and Kya, the marsh girl as they call her isn’t welcome.As well as being a coming of age story, Where The Crawdads Sing has a murder mystery thrown in, as well as a bit of court room drama and romance. It’s a mixed bag but it works so well and although this isn’t a fast paced story it flows and has the reader completely hooked and drawn in. I didn’t want to rush the story, I enjoyed taking my time and absorbing every word.Delia Owens has written a debut novel that is wonderfully descriptive, the marsh comes to life through the words and I felt it was as much of a character as Kya was. The natural beauty and the ever-present wildlife became like a mother to Kya and it was just wonderful to read about.I can honestly say that this book lived up to the hype its receiving and its well deserved, it’s been an absolute pleasure to read and it’s a story that will stay with me for a long time. Where The Crawdads Sing will be one I’ll definitely be recommending, I think it will appeal to many and if you haven’t read it yet then don’t hesitate, it’s wonderful."
Where the Crawdads Sing,The power of the female,5.0,"4.5 starsI have a lot I could say about this book but I'm determined not to spoil it. It is gloriously and evocatively written (I actually listened to it and some of the descriptions of nature brought tears to my eyes). It is a book about the power of nature and the power of women. If you're considering reading it go for it - and give it time. For a while there I almost gave up but that slow start is there for a reason.Two things:-1. There has been a huge amount of negative criticism online about this book and I'm fairly sure had the author been a man (or written under a gender neutral pseudonym) a lot of the criticism wouldn't exist (there is an assumption amongst a certain sort of male reader that women are only capable of writing ""Middlebrow"" fiction.2. You probably will see the twist coming from quite a long way away. But it's OK. As I said, the book is about the power of women, of female creatures in general actually, and so working out the twist will only confirm that.Enjoy."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Absorbing and memorable,4.0,"Kya is ""The Marsh Girl"", who has spent her life living in the marshlands of North Carolina. Since the age of seven she has lived alone, shunning society and finding ways to eke out a living. She knows the marsh like the back of her hand, is familiar with every bird and plant and shell, but she is deeply uncomfortable around people and hardly anyone has ever got close to her. When a body is found in the marshlands, it's natural for the locals to assume that the crazy Marsh Girl must have been the murderer.In many ways this is two books in one. There's the story of how Kya grows up, learns to fend for herself and gradually lets a few people into her world. This part moves slowly, with lots of descriptions of the marshlands and its wildlife. It is atmospheric and haunting. The other part is the murder investigation, which initially is in the background but gradually takes over.If the book was a movie I would rave about the cinematography and directing, but I'd say the acting let it down. There were too many times when we get told how people feel in a situation rather than intuiting it for ourselves. While I could accept that Kya could teach herself so much about the natural world, I found it harder to believe that a woman who barely spoke to other people would have such a rich vocabulary and love of poetry. Nor did I buy into the central relationship between her and Tate. Neither of them ever felt like real people to me and ultimately that meant that the core of this otherwise absorbing and memorable book felt a little hollow."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Where The Crawdads Sing,4.0,"Where the Crawdads Sing is not my usual genre, but I had seen so many wonderful reviews I decided to take a break from my usual thriller reads and try something completely different and I am so glad I did.Where the Crawdads Sing is an absolutely BEAUTIFUL book with exceptional character development, magical and atmospheric descriptions and the language was poetic, raw and breathtaking in places.Set in the 1950’s and 60’s, Kya is a “Marsh Girl” brought up with her older siblings and parents in a shack deep in the North Carolina Coast within the Marshes.  At the tender age of 6 her mother walks out abandoning her children and husband and within a year the rest of the family have left leaving Kya alone to fend for herself.This story centres around the mysterious death of a young man called Chase Andrews and we are taken back and forth from Kya’s earliest childhood memories to the time Chase’s body was found.Without giving anything away Where the Crawdads Sing is a combination of historical fiction, mystery and coming of age.  The spellbinding words bring the Marshes to life and Kya is a character that literally jumps out of the pages, under your skin and buries herself deep into your heart.This is an emotional story of love, loss, abandonment, fear and loneliness but the overall feel is hope.  Highly recommended."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A love song to the Carolina marshes,4.0,"Kya is six (she thinks) and her Ma has just left home.  Her father is violent and often drunk and his beatings drive her elder siblings away one by one.  Soon there is only Kya and her father left and Kya has to learn to cook, clean and survive.  She manages one day of school before being bullied out but she finds it easy to escape the school truancy team by hiding in the marsh.  One day her Daddy doesn't come home and then Kya has to survive the best she can.  Friendship with Tate, a local boy, helps her learn to read and write and Kya falls in love.  When Tate leaves for college Kya falls for a local boy who treats her badly and when he is found dead, Kay is the main suspect.For the majority of this novel I was entranced.  The writing is so lyrical and warm, Kya is a complex and interesting character and I was prepared to forgive the gaping holes in the story because it was almost like a fable, the tale of the Marsh Girl.  However towards the end I found the story far too predictable and the 'twist' at the end was just annoying.  90% of this book is wonderful, the rest lets it down.  However what shines through is the story of the marsh itself, the wildlife, the weather and the whole ecosystem."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Hard read,2.0,"Kya was gradually abandoned by her family, having to grow up and survive on her own in the Marsh. She knew the ins and outs of the swamp, Including the wildlife. She’s a very quiet, shy girl, who keeps herself to herself. She only went to school once in her entire life and hated it, so she kept herself hidden in her shack. Then a boy, who falls in love with Kya teaches her how to read, write and count. She became friends with 2 people from the ‘coloured town’. Jumpin and his wife Mabel, who helped her when she was in desperate need for clothing and food.It is a good story, but painfully slow at the beginning and sudden, short and deflating at the end. From beginning to about half way through, I found it very hard to understand and in some cases, hard to pronounce. As the story went on, it was easier to read. This is because it’s based in North Carolina, where they have the southern twang."
Where the Crawdads Sing,BY FAR ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OUT THERE,5.0,"I picked up this book not expecting much of it because I learned that not all ""hyped"" books are actually that amazing. Well, I was surprised when I couldn’t stop reading. I wanted to go deeper and deeper into the story, I wanted to dive in and take it all with me. I imagined myself in the marsh, quietly observing how a six year old Kya was waiting for her mum to return, was wondering why everyone abandoned her and I felt the loneliness surrounding her but also the incredible determination to survive, to live and learn, to provide for herself and avoid all trouble.Kya is “the marsh girl” – the dirty kid everyone avoids, the uneducated, the savage child nobody wants to have anything to do with and most definitely the one expected to fail. In reality she is a smart and clever girl who knew the marsh and found ways to make money and provide for her basic needs.It is an original story, a true page turner, haunting and unpredictable book. It has it all – a coming of age story, adventure, a murder and mystery but also lots of love. It’s a winner from page one. It is so beautifully written that it wraps around you and captures all your senses.This is by far one of the best books I have ever read and I am so looking forward for the movie. Thank you Reese Witherspoon for deciding on taking this book as a project and for choosing it as your book club pick as well and making it so known in the world of readers.Also, I can say that as a debut novel, Delia Owens climb up the writers ladder very fast and I am so waiting for another incredible book from her."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Amazing book,5.0,"Every now and again, you read a book that simply blows you away. So, this book was ""Where the Crawdads Sing"". It was not only superbly written, moving and intense, but also delivered a great great ending too. I cannot recommend it enough. This is the story of Kya, aka Marsh Girl, a child abandoned by her family, ostracised by people who should have helped her, growing up in the marshes in North Carolina, on the outskirts of Barkley Cove in 50s. Kya learns to trust no one until she grows up and yearns to belong. At the same time, we follow the story of the mysterious death of the popular young man from Barkley Cove - is Kya involved in his death? What has happened to Chase? ""Where the Crawdads Sing"" is a story of heartbreak, loss, loneliness, but also hope, endurance and love. It's poetic language, beautiful descriptions of nature and Kya's isolation are emotional and atmospheric. Although the sadness permeates from pages, there is also beauty, acceptance and quiet endurance. For Kya, nature becomes her mother, the marsh becomes her home and family and despite the sadness, there are also moments of beauty and peace in it. The friendships that Kya develops, the deep understanding of the world around her, it all infuses the book and leaves the reader speechless. This book highly deserves all the praise.I received this book in exchange for an honest review"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautifully written,4.0,"Where the Crawdads Sing is a highly readable novel about Kya, a young girl growing up in abject poverty who has to raise herself in the coastal marshes of North Carolina in the 50s/60s.Essentially a feral child (although bright and literate), Kya has an innate ability to connect with the natural world around her. From the animals to the water and woodland. The most interesting and tender moments focused on her learning to navigate the cruel and confusing 'civilised' world using what she knew of the natural world.There's some YA romance thrown in and a dash of mystery and even a bit of courtroom drama for good measure. The bulk of the book, though, is Kya's relationship with the marsh she calls home and the writing focused on that is immpecable. By contrast the courtroom section feels dry and stale. I'm not sure if this was intentional on the author's part to show the stark contrast between the natural world vs civilisation but even if not, it worked for me.(semi spoiler alert - no details ahead though)I didn't even mind the happy ending and the other thing because they were a footnote in the overall story and the author didn't feel the need to make it long and drawn out. It felt beautifully connected without disrupting the narrative of young Kya.So, all in all, it was a memorable book with some really exquisite moments of descriptive and poetic writing."
Where the Crawdads Sing,5 stars for this beautifully written and emotionally compelling story,5.0,"My heart went out to Kya from the very early pages, the moment when her mum walks out on her when she is just 6 years old. Living in a marshy wilderness alone, Kya is feeling lonely and abandoned, as people in the town turn their backs on her, making her feel unwelcome. Kya only has nature to nurture and protect her when no one else would and the wild creatures of the marsh as her friends.The chapters of Kya's story starting in 1952 are intertwined with murder investigation chapters set in 1969 until the two timelines collide. For one reason or another, Kya becomes the prime suspect in the murder case as she has history with the 'dead' local golden boy and a couple of witnesses can place her near the crime scene. But how can the Marsh Girl get a fair trial with the jury full of prejudiced villagers who rejected and ignored her for years?The vivid depiction of the marsh surroundings, the heartbreaking story of Kya's survival, the suspense of the murder trial and especially Delia Owen's beautiful prose completely sucked me in and made the reading of the novel such a memorable experience. I loved this book and cannot recommend it enough.Many thanks to NetGalley and Little, Brown Book UK for my ARC in exchange for an honest review."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Nice character led, summer read",4.0,"In Where the Crawdad Sings, we follow the trials of Kya, The Marsh Girl, living in the North Carolina swamplands through the 1950s and 60s. Abandoned by all the family she knows by the time she is 10, she is often met with prejudice and suspicion from the local townsfolk.  However Kya shows resilience and fortitude when most people would have given up. Her childhood friendship with Tate is something to be savoured as he shows maturity beyond his years when he teaches her how to read. Once she has the power of words, Kya is truly free “I wasn’t aware that words could hold so much. I didn’t know a sentence could be so full”.Ward’s accurate descriptions of nature obviously come from meticulous research and this enables the reader to see Nature as another character - a third parent that shapes and looks after Kya “Pushing against the sea’s strong body, she is grasped, held. Not alone”.The murder case that is presented in this story is secondary to the power of nature and Kyra’s relationship to it. As a reader we are presented with facts for and against Kya but all we want is for her to be out in the open again and reunited with nature. Whether she is guilty or not doesn’t matter. A fabulous read."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Stunning,5.0,A beautifully written coming of age/mystery novel and love story.It's wonderful to find a book whose words sing out at you and this is certainly in that category.  Owens sense of place is mesmerising and her characters sensitively drawn.The book evokes a time and place that is alien to most of us but we are drawn in to the extent that it becomes so real it's tangible. My heart broke for Kya to extent that I didn't know if I could bear to read on at one point but I'm so glad I did. I won't go into detail and spoil it for those who haven't yet read it but I will say I didn't wee the end coming and that's unusual for me. Very unusual.If I could give this book more than five stars I would. The best book I have read for a long time.
Where the Crawdads Sing,One you'll want to read slowly to make last forever,5.0,"It's all been said before so I'll just say this isn't my usual type of reading at all but with all the hype I felt I was missing out on something and should have a look. I'll be honest and say I put it down about 10% in as I couldn't get going and read a few other books but something drew me back in and I gave it another shot. Am I glad I did that! I adores this beautiful book with it gorgeous descriptions of the area Kya was left to survive in, but without being twee or too much. About 50% in I realised it was one of them books where you want to read fast but at the same time don't because you know you'll be sad when it ends. I was totally enamoured with the poetry included as it's just not for me but I found I could skin read this and move on with the story no problem. All in all I'd describe this book as breathtaking and one that I'll remember for a long time to come."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Great read, but a poor ending...",4.0,"I’m not sure why people have taken such umbrage with this book - I really enjoyed it for the most part. It is beautifully written and the protagonist is extremely likeable. The imagery is good, but it’s not as evocative as I expected from reading other reviews.The book itself is relatively simple and very easy to read. There are aspects of the storyline that seem unbelievable, in this day and age, but it’s important to remember this is set in a different time. (And as a Brit, I’m neither surprised nor shocked by the justice system portrayed, as I don’t know any different.)Without giving away too much, there are times reading this when you feel like pulling your hair out. It is ridiculous and you feel so frustrated for our protagonist. This is how you’re supposed to feel.That being said, I detested the ending to this book. It led me on a journey that had ups, downs and down right stupidity in places and I was rooting for our leading lady at every turn. For a while, I was delighted and then, the last chapter destroyed everything I thought I knew.  Whilst I was extremely disappointed with the turn of events, I can’t say it made me hate everything else I’d read previously. When I think of this book, I’ll remember it fondly and just emit the ending from memory completely!Let’s not forget - this is a work of fiction. Whether you feel the circumstances believable or not, is completely irrelevant. Isn’t that why we read fiction? To get lost in something that’s not real life? If you want something completely relatable and believable, with no mystery or magic, then maybe fiction just isn’t for you."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Absolutely beautiful,5.0,"Nothing pleases me more than a book that is poetic and rich with descriptive prose.  I cannot believe that this is Delia Owen's first fiction book.  It is simply stunning.I was mesmerised from the very first page.  Kya is left by her mother, her siblings and finally by her father.  Alone, this beautiful child learns to survive in the wilds of the marshes.  She is cast out by the villagers who should help her but she continues to thrive with the love of the birds.Her story is poignant and heartbreaking at times but also lifting because it is a story of survival and overcoming prejudice.Sometimes I think I could write a book and then I read something like this and know that never in my lifetime could I create something as beautiful as this book. And so I continue to just be a reader instead so I can enjoy the very skillful craft of writers like Delia."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Thoroughly enjoyed it,5.0,"I’m always a bit wary when it comes to reading a book that has so much hype around it, and has high expectations to meet, but this one certainly didn’t let me down.This book has so much going on in it’s storyline that it covers a range of genre types from Mystery, Romance, Suspense, and Police Procedural. For me, I really enjoy that in a book.The way this book has been written, and the detail in the description that has gone into it,takes you right into the story and gives you such a clear picture of what is going on, some of which fills you with warmth, some of which fills you with dread and sadness.A fabulous “all round” book that I have throughly enjoyed."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Read this book,4.0,"I bought this book because it was recommended to me as a good read. I wasn’t disappointed. The story has so many layers to it, based on one child’s journey into adulthood having been abandoned by those she loves and are supposed to care for her. There are adults who help her from a distance. A local boy teaches her to read and this opens up opportunities for her to thrive. Her situation also makes her vulnerable to abuse of which she suffers to a horrific degree.Alongside the story is a police investigation of the murder of a local resident. These story lines eventually collide and move apart again.The poetry used is the only voice she has to engage with at times and to help her through her emotional rollercoaster.This book examines loneliness, abandonment and societal childcare brilliantly and with great empathy. A really good book."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautiful,5.0,"This is a beautifully written, extremely emotive book. The blurb made it sound absolutely dreadful and I'd never have picked it up if someone hadn't recommended it to me. I laughed out loud when I read the negative reviews on here but then life would be dull if we all liked the same things! I loved it; perhaps the storyline is far fetched in some places (I actually don't think it's implausible and, hey, it's a work of fiction) but the deeper meanings within the storyline really resonated with me. To the people picking apart the police and legal procedures: it's America in the 60s, I wouldn't be surprised. And if you've never ran down a beach screaming to the gulls then, quite frankly, you need to do so immediately."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Reminiscent of A Girl of the Limberlost,5.0,"What a delightful read and it certainly lived up to the hype. The story reminded me of a favourite childhood read ‘A Girl of the Limberlost’ that had me enthralled as a young adult and the same themes run through this book.An abiding and profound love and respect for nature is at the heart of this story and the unlikely heroine, Kya Clark, is brave and resilient in the face of adversity. Abandoned by her mother and siblings and left to fend for herself in a rundown shack with only her drunken father to provide for her, Kya turns to the marsh and the sea and lagoons that surround her. Eventually, even her father fails to return from a bender, and she is all alone. With no money to buy food, she starts selling oysters to buy her necessary provisions and learns to forage and hunt and fish to survive.The natural world around her becomes her classroom and her source of income, and she resists all attempts to by the locals to get her to attend school. She has a deep mistrust of the local people, and they never try to earn her trust; instead they call her names and vandalise her shack and treat her with contempt.Only a local boy called Tate And Jumpin and his wife Mabel go against the current and befriend Kya. Tate teaches her to read, and this opens up a new world to Kya, and Mabel teaches her the facts of life and how to cope with growing into a woman. The book covers so many relevant themes - small-town prejudice, child abuse and child neglect, resilience against all the odds, love and betrayal and racial tensions, all set against the backdrop of a wild and untamed landscape.The author, Delia Owens, is a wildlife scientist as well as a writer and her love of nature comes across vividly in the book. The beautiful descriptions of the marsh and surrounding lagoons transport the reader to another world.Kya’s journey from childhood to adulthood is beautifully written and a joy to read.GillianBreakaway Reviewers received a copy of the book to review"
Where the Crawdads Sing,A beautiful and gripping,5.0,"꧁Ｒｅｖｉｅｗ꧂••𝐖𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐂𝐫𝐚𝐰𝐝𝐚𝐝𝐬 𝐒𝐢𝐧𝐠••“There are some who can live without wild things, and some who can not.”••𝐒𝐮𝐦𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐲For years, rumors of the 'Marsh Girl' have haunted Barkley Cove, a quiet town on the North Carolina coast. So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say. Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life - until the unthinkable happens.••𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰I absolutely loved that we follow Kya throughout her childhood. How she copes with her traumas growing up.  See how she teaches herself to survive in the Marshes. Kya is so resilient and such a strong character as she explores her world.The story focuses on how the town see Kyra and the prejudices against her. She’s just an outsider, a Marsh girl who has to fend for herself, isolated and alone in a vast world with nothing but the gulls to keep her company. I instantly fell in love with her and my emotions ran with hers. She is definitely my favourite character.The story has a gentle flow about it. It’s not too fast paced, not until right at the end. Delia Owens knows how to tell a story with fantastic description. I could just see everything in my imagination. I felt like I was right there with Kya either in the mud flats or on her boat floating around the lagoons. The language was also fantastic.I really enjoyed learning about the nature and biology aspect in the book. Deliah has an unsurpassed knowledge and understanding of nature and I loved how she incorporated that into the story.It was such a beautiful read and will stay with me for a very long time. Definitely has the beginnings of it being a classic.Highly recommend.𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
Where the Crawdads Sing,What a good read!,4.0,"This book is set in the marshlands of the North Carolina coast of America.  Two main threads to the story.  One part starts in the early 1950s, the other in the late 1960s.  The book is about the life of Kya Clark, known locally as the Marsh Girl.  The early 1950s part of the story follows her growing up in the marsh and isolated from most other people in the area.  The 1960s part relates to the discovery of a body of a well known local man who is found dead on the edge of the marshland.  Can these stories really be connected?The setting here, both in terms of place and time, are vivid.  The writing draws pictures effortlessly.  The sense of atmosphere is almost tangible.  The local look down on the marsh dwellers and the marsh is often seen as an inconvenience to be resolved.  Kya grows up loving the place and becoming an expert on it.  As her real family dwindles the gulls and marsh creatures become family.  The marsh itself becomes her playground and school as well as a source of income.I found this book incredibly easy to become immersed in.  Kya is one of those characters who will stay with you for a long time,  Other characters are well rounded and interesting in the main.  It is descriptively very strong however I never felt that this slowed down the narrative.  I became a watcher of Kya's life and felt the highs and the lows.As this book had been published in the USA before it was published in the UK I was able to read reviews of it before I had the opportunity of reading it.  It came over as a remarkable story.  I am somewhat distrustful of books that everyone raves about and I considered not taking it.  However the outline of the story appealed and I'm very glad I read it.  Without question it is one of the best books I've read this year.  It will stay with me for a long time I'm sure.  This is a very rich story of the environment, people and their lives and deaths with a great central character.  What is there to not like - 4.5/5Note - I received an advance digital copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for a fair review"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Gorgeous love song to the beauty of The North Carolina marshlands,5.0,"I listened to this on audible, and it's a good one.  I loved this book so much and would read it again when it comes out in paperback.Coincidentally, like Everything Under by Daisy Johnson, that I just reviewed), parental abandonment, living in the margins and being close to water are also key themes.  This one is set in the marshlands of North Carolina and centres on the story of the extraordinary Kya, The Marsh Girl, who survives alone, living in abject poverty.There is little more I can say without dropping in spoilers.  It's courtroom drama, love story, whodunit, survival story.  But its so much more than that. It's a gorgeous love song to the beauty of the flora and fauna of the marshlands. It is such an unusual setting for a story and you can practically feel the wind in the grasses and see the light on beach. And Kia its towering heroine."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Good!,3.0,"I think the greatest aspect of this book and it’s strength is Kya, she’s feisty with a great sense of self, she has a wild strong will despite everything, and the wilderness where she lived I was fully into, this part of the book in my eyes had a touch of Circe (which I loved) so this got me.However the story then drifts off in a direction I didn’t find overly necessary, it’s heartfelt yes and it’s aims to make the audience think but I liked the wild marsh girl - you can’t please everyone right.But I do recognise this is a strong debut, I can see why people are falling for it all over the place and if you are a fan of books such as Beartown and Little Fires Everywhere I think this is a 2019 must read!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Loved it, so different.",5.0,"I was so sad to read some negative reviews of this book, I have read hundreds of novels during my 72 years and I found this to be absolutely beautiful. It undoubtedly goes into my lifelong top ten. It's a debut novel too.  I loved the beautiful images the writer put into my mind's with her exquisite descriptions of the natural world. It took me right out of my ""coronavirus fug"" for a little while. I love courtroom dramas and enjoyed the one that comes in the final part of this story but the real beauty and joy of this book comes before all that.  It was truly a joyful experience to become so immersed in such a lovely story."
Where the Crawdads Sing,An incredibly beautiful book,5.0,"This book made me laugh, cry and fall in love with the marshland.I absolutely loved this book, it was so beautifully written and brought me to tears a couple of times but made me smile. Kya is such a beautiful character and has such an amazing, deep soul that you can't help being drawn towards.This book is all about Kya who has been abandoned by everyone except the nature around her in the marshlands. She learns from them and learns to fend for herself in a world that is silent from all man-made sounds apart from the marsh boats.This book touches on racism, segregation, abandonment and overall the love we need to be showing each other.I'm having so much trouble reviewing this book because I absolutely loved it and can't fault it at all. This book deserves all the praise it gets. It is magical."
Where the Crawdads Sing,The nuances of a second reading.,4.0,"I first read this book December 2018 and now it has been put on as material for our book club. So I read it for the second time. I was positively impressed on first read and am even more impressed on the second. The strength of the central character is so well developed and that's not to take away from the others. The wildlife observations are so accurately appealing that I feel as though I'm all too familiar with the North Carolina swampland. Setting the story in such a location adds to the ominous undertone running through the account. With being aware osf spoilers, the courtroom scenes are possibly a little long drawn out. Perhaps the book didn't need the last chapter; there's a whole other book to tell the rest of Kya's life"
Where the Crawdads Sing,1960's fairy tale,4.0,"An interesting books I thoroughly enjoyed as some other reviews have stated it is far fetched, if you look pass that and enjoy the story. The descriptions of the marsh are realistic, saltiness in the air,a sand between your toes, the sun on your face.  Kya is a delight an abandoned child left to grow and evolve in her marsh world. Learning about the male species. She learn to read with the help of her friend Tate. Her journey as she grows. its an easy read I did look up on the map where it was based to get an understanding of the location. Partly predictable but didn't stop me from finishing the book (Kindle)  read with my local ""Hunters"" book club."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A breathtaking and spectacular debut,5.0,"Breathtaking, mesmerising, haunting, beautiful, heartbreaking and unforgettable: just a few words that first come to mind when I think of this sensational book.The story begins in 1969 when two young boys discover the body of local football hero Chase Andrews lying in the Marsh.  There is immediate suspicion that the death is not accidental and talk of who could have wanted to kill him.  We then go back to 1952 where six-year-old Kya is sat on the front porch watching in disbelief as her “Ma” walks away in her best shoes carrying a suitcase.  The book then continues in dual timelines: we follow the hunt to find who killed Chase as the police try to ascertain what is rumour and gossip and what is fact, and also watch as Kya grows up on the Marsh and learns to not only survive, but flourish.Reading about how Kya lives was difficult and heartbreaking.  She is seen as “Marsh Trash” by those who live in Barkley Cove, and avoided and vilified by adults and children alike.  After her Ma leaves, her siblings soon follow and she is left alone with her Pa, a violent drunk who is often absent.  When he eventually abandons her too she has to find a way to make an income and finds a friend in Jumpin,who owns Gas and Bait which sells gas and groceries, and his wife Mabel.  Her one day at school was a disaster so she gets her education from the world around her and studies the Marsh, sea and sand.  For many years she’s unable to read but then Tate, who was a friend of her older brother, offers to teach her.  They inevitably fall in love and he awakens a side to Kya she didn’t have before, one where she needs someone and enjoys another person’s company.  When he leaves her heartbroken she feels unable to trust anyone and completely withdraws into herself and her Marsh again, determined never to rely on anyone but herself from now on.Very quickly after Chase is found, suspicion from the townspeople falls on the Marsh Girl, who was rumoured to have had some kind of relationship with him at one point.  Her elusive behaviour each time the police try to talk to her doesn’t help convince people of her innocence. It seems even in the absence of evidence most people have decided they know what happened and convicted her of the crime in their jury of small-town opinion.By the time I was half way through the book I was consumed and couldn’t stop reading. It was a completely different book to what I expected it to be, although I don't really know what I expected. I knew I had a book I loved on my hands and that the trepidation that comes with reading a much talked about, hyped book was unnecessary.The author has a remarkable ability to make you feel and understand from Kya’s perspective in this book.  You feel her crippling loneliness at a life lived truly alone, her overwhelming fear of anything or anyone outside the Marsh, admiration that she surviving such a life and all she accomplished despite the odds, and anger at the way she was treated, judged, used and failed by almost everyone she meets.Delia Owens is a phenomenal writer, and Where The Crawdads Sing is a spectacular debut.. It is a long book and I admit there were times that reading it felt like a slog, but that was because of the southern dialect and heavy subject matter and not because of boredom.  I loved this story and it didn’t take long for me to find it hard to put down. It is an eloquently written, powerful, emotive, and extraordinary novel.  It is a masterpiece that you won’t be able to forget and will stay with you long after you read it."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Where the Crawdads Sing,5.0,"I have to admit that I was first drawn to this book because the title intrigued me. Then I read the blurb and a couple of reviews and I thought this would tick a box I needed from a read at the moment. I have read a few books recently which have been somewhat spoiled for me as I managed to guess too much too early and really wanted something that would wow me and I figured that this could be the book to do just that. And I am very pleased to say that I wasn't wrong as I absolutely loved the book from start to finish.We follow Kya from her time as a small child as, one by one, her family start leaving her until she is left with only her father. She has to grow up quick as he is not really the fatherly type and soon starts to become resourceful, which is a good thing as soon she finds herself all alone. Dodging the education authorities, she learns to survive mostly from what she learns about the marsh in which she resides but she does also have a bit of help from a few very lovely people.In amongst watching Kya grow up and blossom into a woman, we also go forward in time where the body of a young man has been found and follow the police as they try and make sense of what happened to him. As the two threads progress, eventually they start to give sense to each other and the whole truth eventually comes out.This really was the most beautiful book. Not just Kya's story, which in itself was fascinating and emotional, but also learning about the place she calls home; the marsh and the flora and fauna contained therein. I really did lose myself in the atmosphere of the place and whenever I closed my eyes I could see it all clearly, something that doesn't often happen as I am not usually a very visual reader. Even though my main go-to genre is crime, at times I got so lost in Kya and the marsh that I almost forgot that there was also a crime to figure out along the way. Until, that is towards the end where it all started getting a bit clearer and, hand in hand with that, a bit more emotional too.Oh how I loved Kya, she pretty much ran me the gamut of emotions as I learned more about her, as I saw her grow and come of age. How I started to wish that the book would last forever so that I wouldn't ever have to leave her. She definitely took a big place in my life for the duration of my reading this book.It's a book of survival against the odds, of resilience, loss and hope and many more things in between. It's a tale of not fitting in but then finding a way to fit in, to trust. It's a book that I am so glad I read and one of the very few that I will probably re-read and that total is still in single figures despite reading more than 300 books a year past few years. At the moment, and I know it's still early days, it's my favourite book of 2019 and I am sure will still be top ten by December 31st.My thanks go to the Publisher and Netgalley for the chance to read this book."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Good story and very atmospheric descriptios,5.0,"I really loved this book. The descriptions of the marsh, the little town, and the people were so detailed that you felt you could see them. The narrator in this audible book was brilliant and used different voices for each character and really hit the Carolina accent.I have been to the area so it did help me to picture the scenes. the marshes, the inlets and bays and I could almost see Kaya in her little aluminum boat.This is a love story, a mystery, and a detective story as well as a very sensitive portrayal of loneliness and how one little girl manages to survive by herself by immersing herself in nature that surrounds her."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Spoiler Alert,3.0,"For years, rumours of the 'Marsh Girl' have haunted Barkley Cove, a quiet town on the North Carolina coast. So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead,the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl.***I'm conflicted....In two minds about how it is I truly feel about this book and no doubt I will probably at some point amend my review.But for now this book for me is only worth a 3/5* stars and my reasons for this review are that while I loved the main character Kya. Honestly fell in love with the lonely girl who against all odds not only survived but thrived after being abandoned by her whole family. I found the actual story lacking.Her plight as a child in the first half of the book had me hooked, desperate to discover how this fragile creature would survive, not just being left alone in the marsh but the people of the town too... But by the time the second half started and we began to follow Kya throughout her teenage and adult years, I found myself at odds with the story and I actually put it down for two solid days before resuming. Not out of my love the book but out of my desire to know what happened to that little girl I fell in love with.Over all unfortunately it left me feeling underwhelmed. But that could just be a by product of all the hype and the expectations I had laid at this novels feet even before I picked it up.In summary it wasn't a bad book, it didn't leave me wanting to put it in the bin, but it also didn't leave me wishing the story would never end so that I could stay in Kya's world just a little longer."
Where the Crawdads Sing,I loved it!,4.0,"There are mixed reviews on here, and on my book group page. Personally I loved it, I thought this book was beautifully written and descriptive. I now always order the sample on kindle and if I'm enjoying it, I buy the book. Some people on my book group said it was slow to start and they gave up reading it (some of these were 'Fifty Shades' lovers so couldn't really take their reviews seriously!) but I didn't find that to be the case, I was sucked in straight away and had me gripped right to the end, although I did feel the ending was a little rushed maybe. People have different reading tastes... some will love it, some will hate it. If you really want to read it, then read it and don't be put off by the bad reviews. Each to their own!!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Where The Crawdads Sing,4.0,"Where The Crawdads Sing is the story of Kya, a young girl who is abandoned by her family and left to fend for herself. Already on the outskirts of the  community, in more than just her location, she rarely ventures out of the marshes and spends her days learning about the habitat around her. When she does let the outside world in, she learns that it can be both scarier and more accepting than she could ever have imagined.The lyrical and descriptive writing made this a very easy book to listen to and get lost in. The descriptions of the marshes were so in depth I was almost transported there.I did feel it was a little bit slow to start, but once it picked up, I really didn't want to put it down."
Where the Crawdads Sing,On Her Own,4.0,"A good storyline, but it takes a great deal of imagination to believe the storyline. The saving grace is the timeline- 1949 to 1969. In these times you can very well understand that a young girl could fend on her own. She has the townsfolk of jumpin to help her with food and clothes, and enough knowledge to help her through her life.One by one kya’s family left her. First her mom, then her sisters and brother. It was her father, a drunkard who drove them away. And, then, he was gone, and Kya had to figure out how to sustain herself. She had enough common sense and knowledge to learn how to cook and fish. She lived in her ramshackle shack by herself, but few bothered her. The local truant Officer came to bring her to school, where she was ridiculed, and she never went back.This is Kya’s story, how she brought herself up, how the black family helped her, and how she learned to read and write. The rest of her story is for you to learn.Recommended. prisrob 04-30-19"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautiful,5.0,"What a work of art Ms Owens has created here. The writing is so lyrical it's like listening to a 12 hour long song. The story sweeps you up, capturing your body, soul and imagination. I was on a journey with Kya, her loneliness was palpable at times and her evolution into a vital part of the marsh, until she genuinely was 'The Marsh Girl' was sad and heart breaking. Then you realise that, in fact, the marsh provides Kya the kind of safety and succour that no human ever quite matched. Ultimately, Kya finds a peace and happiness that most of us can only dream about. A remarkable book, exquisitely narrated by Cassandra Campbell and definitely not to be missed."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Evocative and memorable,5.0,"I loved this book. I first became aware of it ,when I heard that Daisy Edgar-Jones had been cast as Kya in the film of the book. Daisy was brilliant in Normal People, so I was keen to read the book about a future role she would be doing.When I went onto Amazon to look at the book, I was amazed at the number of reviews. It was over 125,000 at the time (now 135,000). Correct me if I'm wrong but I think this is the most reviewed book ever on Amazon, by quite some way.Yes the detractors will say it's implausible, but for me it's a beautifully written love story and murder mystery, combined with wonderful descriptions of the natural world.The courtroom scenes at the end genuinely had my heart racing, and the ending is a good twist.All in all a fantastic read, and I can't wait for the film"
Where the Crawdads Sing,It was..ok,3.0,"For someone who isn't big on nature, the novel certainly turned that around on me which I appreciated and I was able to get lost if you like in the way in which Owens depicts the marshland scenery through her language. I also found the whole first half of the novel compelling and sad in telling of Kya's upbringing and how she became to be the way she was. However the second half of the book I found the book lost its pace and in the end the plot became rushed. I don't think it lives up to the hype of these reviews."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Bestseller for a reason,5.0,"I almost was not going to buy this book based on the amazon & goodreads negative reviews, but received this as a gift.  It was a little slow to begin with, but I was glad that I stuck with it, as it then became a page turner.I have never read a story about a girl growing up in the marshes, it was unusual, strong themes of abandonment, prejudice, survival, love/friendship and surrounded by nature.  My verdict on the book is, it was an enjoyable read and I could immerse myself in the story and the setting, I like to be able imagine where the character is and I had a good picture of this."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Don't get the hype,1.0,I don't often write reviews but I just had to for this book. No offence to the author but it was absolutely awful. I am very open minded when it comes to fiction but this was so boring. I made it to the end of the book but only because I read it for my book club. The characters are so undeveloped and the whole plot is completely unbelievable. I really don't get the hype.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Definitely not a book to read in lockdown,3.0,"I was rather disappointed by this book and slightly mystified by the description of this book as 'just lovely' by all my friends. On the one hand, it is beautifully written - a haunting elegy to the redemptive power of nature and a beautiful love story. On the other hand, it was a total downer with its main themes of abuse, abandonment, prejudice and isolation. I had to take a two-week break in the middle because I was so depressed by the whole thing: this poor child abandoned at the age of six - first by her mother, then by all her siblings and eventually by her alcoholic, abusive father - and left to fend for herself.  Although she eventually makes something of herself due to the kindness of an older boy, who teaches her to read and shares her fascination with zoology and biology, her loneliness and isolation permeates every page of this book.  Definitely not a book to read in lockdown, particularly not if you live on your own! I also found the characterisation somewhat lazy and predictable: prejudiced, small-minded, predatory white townsfolk versus the kind, warm-hearted black characters, Jumpin' and Martha, who take pity on the poor, motherless child - her 'otherness' equating her with them.  Not my idea of a 'lovely' book at all."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Amazing,5.0,"I understand why this book received the many accolades it did.An incredible tale of a young girl being left to fend for herself in the swamps of Mississippi basin. Being left first by her Mother and then her Father made her grow up fast and fearless.Se experiences both happy and unhappy friendships with boys.I found the fact that given her unfortunate background her ability to write and publish books seemed a little far fetch.However that is what story telling is about.Eventually settling down with the love of her life after the wickedness of a former boyfriend leads to a happy ending,or was it?"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Fantastic read best read for years,5.0,Beautiful fantastic read please take no notice of negative reviews about it being unrealistic a girl fending for herself etc. I just don't think they have a good sense of what this book does and how it's meant to be fiction written in the best way possible. Books are meant to take you to a story that creates atmosphere and happiness sadness and mystery This book does all that and more. Read and enjoy it's not meant to be non fiction who ever thought it was with such negative reviews need to look at the factual section of books.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Loved the first part but hated the last few chapters,3.0,I loved the beginning of this book but hated the end.  Everything in the middle was entertaining enough but it fell short for me - but I often feel this way about over hyped books though.  The bar of expectation is raised so high that it's almost bound to fail.Kya's story was incredibly sad at the beginning and it was part 1 of the book that moved me the most.  The last few chapters felt rushed and I wish that the author hadn't felt the need to tie up loose ends.  I'd rather have left some of the answers to my own imagination!
Where the Crawdads Sing,Good but not perfect,4.0,"I resisted buying this book for a while as the reviews were fairly polarized.  And some of the negative reviews suggested to me that I wouldn't like it.  However, in our third lock down I was desperate for something light and easygoing to read.  And to be fair that's what I got.  It's nicely written, the story is mostly engaging, and all in all it whiled away a weekend.  I think the author should have had the confidence to concentrate on the main story line (the young girl fending for herself, educating herself and becoming an expert on the wildlife in her very specific area of the country) - it was strong enough on its own to carry the book, and had she concentrated on that she would have been able to do it more justice.  It really didn't need the extra plot line of a suspicious death.  I'll try the author's next book (if there is one) in the hope that the quality of the writing continues but the author has confidence in her story telling and doesn't get led off down side tracks and over complicates things."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A lovely heart warming story,5.0,"I loved this book from the minute it started, true it's hard to believe a child could fend for herself from such a young age, but not beyond the realm of possibility. The narrator was fabulous and there was so  much feeling in the story telling. The story flowed so well and the characters were all well written, you could imagine the way Kia was treated by the town folk. The description of the marsh with it's flora, fauna and amazing birdlife was fabulous, you could picture the beaches, waterways and everything about the area. Brilliant writing look forward to the next Delia Owens book."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A mixed bag,3.0,"I listened to the audio book version (excellent narration) Not sure I would have stuck with it had I been reading it. The positives: beautiful writing about nature and it made me want to know more about the Carolinas (? Correct spelling) negatives: wondered if slightly implausible that a young child would be able to survive alone for so long and would a rickety shack have stayed upright so long .... just s few of the many things that seemed a tad unlikely. Maybe that’s not entirely fair on the author, it is after all, a work of fiction. Overall, enjoyed it."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Loved this,4.0,"Well goodness me - never seen so many reviews almost re-telling the entire story !  And so many dissenters - Yes it was implausible.  But how many books arent?  I dont mind fanciful if theres also an abundance of skilled, thought provoking writing.  Im still reeling at the real life prejudice in the backwaters of the U.S. in relatively recent times.Nor did I see the ending telegraphed at all!  I was absorbed from start to finish and enjoyed every single page.  For a first novel it was stunning !!!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Breathtaking.,5.0,"What a fabulous read. I went through a whole range of emotions. Although the style is more descriptive than I normally like, it fitted well, and painted such a picture of Kya's life and environment that it became part of the story. For most of Kya's young life I felt uncomfortable as a reader that a child was forgotten about to such an extent. As the story went on I felt nothing but admiration for the resilience of the human spirit. What a wonderful person. I held my breath during most of the trial and thought I knew what had really happened - until the very end. I'm so glad our book club chose this to read."
Where the Crawdads Sing,An extraordinary and brilliant achievement,5.0,"This is one of the most beautiful and moving novels I have ever read.  It is brilliantly paced and constructed.  The way the events of different periods intertwine gives it a terrific momentum, making it a book that can barely be put down, it is so compelling.  The backdrop of the marshlands and their wildlife is unique and extraordinary.  And then, at the heart, we have the amazing story of the Marsh Girl and her heart-rending experiences that lead up to the final story of the murder of Chase Andrews, Kya’s trial, the restoration of Tate as her true and constant love, and the final dénouement.  Crawdads ranks with ‘The God of Small Things’ written by Arundhati Roy many years ago, which set a new standard of story-telling.  Like ’Small Things’, ‘Crawdads’ portrays a woman as victim in an unusual location, with a marvellous sense of time and place, wonderfully drawn characters - good as well as evil - and unexpected twists and turns before the final episode."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Oh! It's gender war diatribe.....,1.0,"You will be familair with the ""daddy-issues"" formula before you open this book but this one is so far-fethched it makes the Jungle Book look like a documentary, but has nowhere near the charm.Blah, blah blah....neglectful drunk of a father unable to cope ith life in the ""swamp"" (geddit?).Blah, blah, blah six year old child is so much more mature....so sensitive and intuitive and nurturing and earth goddess and etc etcCliche-riddled pap that appeals to a tedious demographic!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Ecology with a sting,5.0,"The wildlife is all-embracing and the description deeply poetic, but the social world breaks in with rape and murder, and the effect so shocking that I had to start reading the book all over again.  It is hard to believe in the accomplishments of Kya - naturalist, artist, poet, survivor - until one remembers the genius of autistic savants.  I thought the Sheriff and his assistant were just there for laughs until I was jolted into taking them seriously.  An astonishing literary achievement!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,A tale of escape and adventure,4.0,"This is such a readable story following Kya's life from abandoned little girl to feted wildlife writer and beyond. There are passages of touching descriptions, time passing and wistful desires as Kya is left to fend for herself and grow up very much alone.She discovers who her true friends are and the extent of her powers as time passes and events happen that shape her life and those around her.I enjoyed being wrapped in a very different life for the duration of the book, and being surprised by the ending."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Beautifully written, includes everything from marginalisation to human relations, to nature",5.0,"Absolutely amazing. The author brilliantly describes isolation and the environment in which the protagonist lives in. The book successfully describes feelings of loneliness and how it feels to be jilted and marginalised based on your looks, poverty and the myths of the “other“.  I have never been tearful about injustice but this book really manages to capture it beautifully, leaving you angry and sad about the predicament of the protagonist.  The plot twist at the end of the book really ends the story beautifully and I couldn’t have asked more from the book."
Where the Crawdads Sing,I didn’t want it to end,5.0,I absolutely loved this beautiful story which I purchased as an Audible audio book. I initially found the narrator’s voice a bit irritating (but I often do) but soon warmed to her.It is such a gentle story which I never wanted to end. The landscape was so beautifully described and woven into the story that I now desperately want to visit the marshland. The main character is so well put across. I found myself snatching every spare moment to press play on my phone and listen to a bit
Where the Crawdads Sing,An engaging debut,4.0,"I enjoyed this book and I think that for  a debut novel it's pretty good.  The author really brings the marshland to life, as you would expect from someone who writes nature books.The ending is quite predictable in my opinion and I agree with some reviewers that the dialogue is a bit stilted and cumbersome at times but I was hooked.I'm always a little wary of books that attract a lot of hype and high ratings but on the whole I was not disappointed with this."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A truly wonderful read,5.0,"I completely loved this book and it had me entranced from beginning to end. You really took Kya into your heart: the balance of her mature strength and yet with such childish innocence  made her such a compelling character. I also loved some of the support characters such as Jumpin and Mabel, they really helped to bring the book alive.The descriptive detail really made you feel like you knew the town and the Marsh but it never went so far as to override the narrative. This novel had charm and heartbreak in equal measure and I adored it!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Very slow starter that evolves into a fantastic story,5.0,"Reviews for this book are at opposite ends of the spectrum. It is so slow starting that I very nearly gave up. Many others do. But I didn’t. The story evolves so well and without the leisurely build up I doubt what unfolds would hit you like it does. I read the last quarter in one go before work for 2 hours. Just couldn’t put it down. The end was very emotional. I don’t think any book I’ve read had such an emotional impact at certain points. I’d recommend this one. But it does start very slow so if you want instant action, try something else."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Enjoyable, despite my two stars.",2.0,"Not sure why some Amazon reviewers give away virtually the whole plot, but those who have may save you the task of actually reading the book.Here, nature is well observed by an author who clearly knows her subject, and often beautifully described,  but the idea of a marsh girl growing up and fending for herself without serious mishap, or adult intervention,  is totally unbelievable.  Also unbelievable is the idea that said 'marsh girl' is self-educated to such a level as to become a respected and published writer and illustrator in her chosen field.The 60s was a tumultuous decade and I found the almost complete lack of reference to events like the Vietnam War or the Space Race annoying too and just compounded the lack of plot cred.However, if you allow for artist license, it is still a good read and despite the two stars, I listened to it on Audible and it kept me company on some long walks, and I was interested as to what happened and I am sure Reece Witherspoon will do a good job with the TV rights if she has them.Lastly, I really do wish I could read a contemporary novel one day which doesn't involve the main protagonist becoming a best selling writer/published author. Such a hackneyed plot device."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A beautiful book that will always have my heart!,5.0,"After seeing this book everywhere, I couldn’t wait to get my hands on it. From the synopsis I was intrigued to feel the emotions that are woven throughout the story. Emotion is a key to me enjoying a book, the deeper the emotional eruption whilst reading a book, the more I know I will love it. And my gosh…this book did just that! From the first sentence, Owen’s writing was bursting with spirit. It felt like I was secured in a vacuum of energy and as the story progressed the pulse of the vibrations grew and grew. This vibrancy allowed my mind’s eye to embellish the world in which the characters existed, down to being able to visualise the very fine details of the many birds, shells and feathers Kya loved.I fell in love with Kya from the moment she was introduced to us. She is shy and timid but also one of the strongest characters I have ever known. Although Owen’s describes to us Kya’s psychical beauty through words, if you look deep enough you will also find her inner beauty. Hidden in her love and understanding for the marsh and her silent exchanges with the wildlife.‘Where the Crawdads Sing’ is a story of love and loss. It exposes to us both the negative and positives that come with solitude but most of all…if we just take a bit of time to get to know those we see as outsiders, maybe we will see that they are worthy of love to."
Where the Crawdads Sing,An exquisite piece of writing,5.0,"There is something old-fashioned, and rather uplifting, about this exquisitely written book. Okay, it is pretty easy to pick holes in the plot but, so long as you suspend your cynicism, it flows beautifully. It is not intended to be a Michael Connelly forensic crime thriller. I am a 69 year old man, and I suspect that I am not the intended target audience, but I absolutely loved it. I wish I could find more of this quality of writing. Delia Owens and Ivy Pochoda are my finds of 2019."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Aw I really loved this book...,5.0,"Aw I really loved this book...I found the start of this book a little slow but at the end I couldn't put it down and read it all in a couple of days... And I don't often do that.It's a light story with heavy undertones to it. Breath of fresh air, freeing, pleasant and from the start you just want well for the kid, which the author just makes you feel for her from the start!Even though you want and feel this book will have a happy ending it just keeps you turning the pages literally until the very end which I was impressed with.I like a nice story, Im not going to go fact checking each detail there is no point. The author let me live the story with Kya and I enjoyed it so much."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"What a beautiful, beautiful book",5.0,"My favourite novels tend to be those which tell a great story in wonderful prose; a central character (and many others) who I feel I get to know personally (or wish I had); set in contexts and surroundings which teach me things, while affecting me deeply.This is one of those books. From the off, I felt I was present in the story, at the place, with the characters. And, long after putting it down, my mind still wanders back there. To the marsh and swamplands of North Carolina...Another one please."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A beautiful story,5.0,"i had this book sitting on my kindle for a while before I started it as it didn’t really seem like my type of book. I bought it because of all the glowing reviews and I didn’t want to miss out.Anyway, how wrong I was. I was so intrigued  by Kya from the very start, and although nature hasn’t really interested me in the past, I absolutely loved reading about the setting. As the story continues, we grow to love Kya and feel every pain she does. I just wanted her to come out on top but I won’t spoil it for you.A truly lovely story and very well written. Five stars from me."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Perfect escape from stressful times,5.0,"Despite some very poor reviews I took a chance on this and I’m glad I did,sad and beautiful story set in the 60s and 70s,includes the awful social and racial prejudices that were openly rife in these decades, I will remember Kya,Mabel,Jumpin and Tate for a long time as they were so well developed I felt I knew them,brilliant read if u need to escape reality for a little while....apparently being made into Hollywood movie which I can’t wait to see"
Where the Crawdads Sing,The nature writing is the best part,2.0,"The author tells a story of a child growing up in extreme loneliness, an outcast from society who must depend on herself for survival. She has a strong interest in nature and animals and understands these better than people. I'm guessing that the author is very much telling her own life experience of social rejection using the swamp context and adding in a murder plot line. She describes the pain of that loneliness in the beginning quite well, as though she has experienced it herself. It is also quite clear from her writing of dialogue that she has poor insight and understanding of people's behaviour, thoughts, and motivations and it makes for strange and unlikely dialogue, particularly between the main character and her love interests. In the midst of all of this, she writes in intense detail about the creatures of the swamp and this is where she excels. The book also features an unusual focus on bird feathers which was interesting but a bit too much. I would not be surprised if the author is somewhere on the autism spectrum actually. I think she did well for her first book however and hopefully she will develop her ability to write about relationships in her future endeavours."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Not for me,3.0,"Beautifully written with some wonderful characterisation, I have to be honest and say I think it has been a little over hyped.The story starts well but then seemed to drift and I found myself skipping bits. I loved the descriptions of the marsh and its wildlife but aspects of the story left me cold.I really wanted to enjoy this but I wasn't rushing to pick it up."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautifully written.,5.0,"There are so many reviews that I don't see the need for another. The writing is so vivid I felt and smelt and saw all life in the marshes. Truly a memorable book. One little error that I find extraordinary from an author who is obviously a respected scientist - you do not feed bread to birds. They can't digest it and it can kill them. And, I hate to admit this, I don't think the ending works. Leave the death of Chase as unsolved; more believable."
Where the Crawdads Sing,It’s not literature - but it is a nature bath for covid isolation,4.0,"I am surprised by the number of negative reviewsThis isn’t literature and the hype has been immenseBut it has good plot and the setting is  evocative - the North Carolina marshes are perfect for U.K. covid isolation dreamersThe beginning, with a little girl abandoned by her family was very clearly drawn ... I could see that family , their home, smell their foodI found it  hard to put down !"
Where the Crawdads Sing,"WOW, just WOW, Best book I have ever read",5.0,"I feel all grown up, I have read a book and posting a review. After asking everyone to review my books I feel it only fair I join in.My review of, Where the Crawdads sing - Deliia Owens 5 Massive StarsWhere do I start, well it is the best book I have ever read (listened to) yes, but this comes with a caveat as I have only read 17 books in my life and written two which I know is weird. What I learned as an author is the way the marshland and Kia's journey was described, simply superb.We grow up with her, a little girls journey to womanhood, living through what she had to put up with and all of what life threw at her. There are two stories going on in two different timelines, Kia growing in front of our eyes and a murder which happens much later. As the reader we are teased with bits and pieces of information as the two timelines are set on a collision course. I cant say to much more about the story but don't want to spoil it for you, it might be a little long in parts but the way the march is described and the array of colourful characters that touch our hero's life can't fail to drag you in. I think I need to up my game, As a non-reader I commend the author for helping me fall in love with reading again, soon to be a film I here, I cant wait.Simply wonderful, storytelling at its best. Well done Delia, take a bow, masterpieceA nod must also be given to the narrator and that southern Deep South drawl, loved it"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Must read,5.0,"Having heard so much about this book from my fellow book buddies in the US- I knew I needed to read this book.I started reading this book as part of a book reading group. However sadly I had to leave the group because I was so far ahead.It is a story that is a true page turner.It is about a girl called Kya  a 6 year old girl is left on her own. People that she is/was close to have left her.Chase Andrews turns up dead.I dont want to reveal anymore but there is plenty to get your teeth into.Murder, mystery, abandoment.  So much it just leaves you wanting moreHighly recommended"
Where the Crawdads Sing,A Captivating Story,5.0,"I loved this book. It was one of those books that captivate you so much that you cannot  put it down. The depth of description that went into the main character was excellent. The description of the Marsh, indeed that of the whole natural world, was so good, it cleverly created a vivid picture in my mind.The exploration of loneliness and poverty was well thought out, disturbing but equally heartening.This is a book that stay with you, I would highly recommend it."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Riveting and memorable,5.0,"Wow - what a story. I'd heard good reviews about this but it took me a while to warm to buying it so when ! finally came across it in a charity bookshop, I decided to dive right in. The story is unusual. Owens creates a vivid picture of her protagonist Kya and I wasn't sure what to make of it all at first but the more I read, the more I needed to know where it was all going. And I wasn't disappointed. A riveting and memorable 5-star read and one of my favourites so far this year..."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Uniquely brilliant.,5.0,This was a gift to me and I have to say it would not have been one I would normally have chosen myself  but it was simply stunning. The further I got into the story the more intrigued I became. The background details of the marsh land where it is set are detailed but not over done to spoil the flow of the story. And the ending?? Well it deserved more than the 5 points I can give it. Read and enjoy!!
Where the Crawdads Sing,Lovely book,5.0,"I loved this book , perhaps the marsh girls achievements were a little exaggerated but the general story line is different and interesting , I was sad to finish and really didn’t see the twist at the end until it happenedPlease take a moment to push the helpful button and make my time typing up and reviewing worthwhile 🥰"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Mud girl,1.0,"A 6 years old, who has experienced trauma and abuse, is competely abandoned by everybody and starts eating dirt and charcoal, turning into a beautiful woman whose main purpose is to shag the pretty boys. When she is 14 the pretty boy teaches her to read and write within a few days and she starts speaking like David Attenborough. Also there are 2 black people that are there just as decorative stereotypes, probably shaped around dr Owens very own idea of black people. So the mud girl marries one of the pretty boys and kills the other one, and she manages to get away with it. She also publishes a number of biology books, written all on her own.At the same time you are asked to feel for her because she is discriminated against, just like the marginal black characters. Yep, Delia Owens thinks that in the segregated south a poor white woman and a black person have interchangeable experiences.There is also a bad poetry subplot and some marsh descriptions, bit it's mainly about a mud girl who wants to shag."
Where the Crawdads Sing,The Magic of Beautiful Writing,5.0,"Delia Owens’ Where the Crawdads Sing is a novel that literally took my breath away. It wasn’t a perfect book – I’ll get to a couple of criticisms later – but it was profoundly moving, exquisitely written, believable in an unbelievable kind of way and, in some parts, as compelling as a thriller. I suppose it could be defined as a modern-day fairy tale, with all the grit and dark edges of authentic, uncensored fairy tales – the good and bad, the love and hate, brutality, beauty and ugliness – but with the added plausibility of real, rugged earthiness. It was a novel that made me feel alive; that made me look at my own existence in a different way. Here was a writer who knew how to write about love, loss and solitude in a manner that resonated with me wholeheartedly.In a nutshell, Where the Crawdads Sing is the haunting story of Kya, better known by the narrow-minded local villagers as the ‘marsh girl’ – a child who was abandoned by her impoverished family and forced to live entirely alone, fending for herself in a tumbledown shack on the wild coast of North Carolina. It is a story of love found in unexpected places; it’s also a story of inner-belief and self-development. Ultimately, it's a story of hope and determination: about the will to live, to be loved, and to persevere against all odds. There are two concurrent timelines that interweave throughout the novel – one of them in 1969/70, the other in the 1950s – until eventually they both converge into a powerful denouement. The modern-day timeline follows the development of a murder enquiry; the earlier timeline centres around Kya's childhood and her growth into womanhood.Personally, I’m not someone who is mad about nature - although I like it enough when I behold the first buds of spring peeking out from the dormant soil in my back garden. Yet in the pages of this novel I found the author’s descriptions so seductive, at times it really was as though I was actually there, in that marshy, muddy, tangled, utterly lush coastline that permeates the entire story. It was only after finishing the novel that I read up about the author, and when I realised that she’s a scientist, then I said, Ahh! to myself, smiling in that hugely satisfying feeling of it figures! Generally speaking, I try not to read an author’s bio before finishing their book, because I don’t like being influenced in any way. I’m a firm believer that the characters and storyline in a novel should speak for themselves, and that the reader should not be aware of the author’s presence at all.This brings me to one minor criticism. I don’t like mixed point of view, and this book has a quite lot of it. For me, I would prefer the author to disappear entirely, so that the pages of her book can be occupied purely by her characters. They are the ones who should manipulate the reader, not the author. And when you are forced inside the thoughts of more than one character at a time, within the same chapter, that’s when the authorial presence takes over. Get out! I want to yell. Let me be alone with your characters!The other minor criticism I have is that the final quarter of the novel turns into a courtroom drama, which I felt was a little too long and somewhat out of keeping with the mood of the rest of the story. But at the same time I was still glued to the pages, so I’m not even sure if this is a valid criticism.But the very fact that, despite those two criticisms, I still feel compelled to give this novel a five-star rating, shows just how deeply I fell in love with it. When you’re truly besotted with a person, you don’t care about the faults in them, right? You know they’re there, but somehow, you just overlook them. That’s the magic of love.When the Crawdads Sing was true magic for me. I am infinitely grateful to Delia Owens for having lighted up my life for the too-short time that I was allowed to be part of her marshy, lonely, at times cruel, yet ultimately beautiful, world."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Excellent audio book,5.0,The narrator of this book is excellent in that she has the correct accent and intonation for the story and brings it all vividly to life as she reads.  I love the authors beautiful descriptions of the North Carolina marsh area in particular the physical geography and birdlife.  There is a good solid storyline weaving through the book and I am thoroughly enjoying this listening experience.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Not worth the hype.,1.0,"I so wanted to like this book because I have a lot of friends who said it was absolutely wonderful and you felt you were right in nature. So, I thought I was in for an absolute treat. I started to read it and felt as if I was in a swamp up to my neck. While the descriptions of nature and the natural world are very good the plot is not believable. I felt a little connection with the characters and the murder mystery seem to be shoehorned into the last section of the novel. And as for the dreadful poetry. And the ending. I hate to give up on a novel. Especially one recommended by so many people.. But I wish I had saved myself the time and read something much better."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Quite good but quite live up to the hype,4.0,I was interested to read this book because of the huge number of sales. While this was a nice coming of age story it is over-hyped. For me there was too much description of the surrounding North Carolina marshlands which slowed the story down somewhat. I preferred the second half of the book particularly the court scenes and the twist at the end. I believe this is being made into a film which I look forward to seeing.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Not great,1.0,"What utter dross! I had great hopes for this book having read the many positive reviews, but after persevering I now wonder if I read the same book as everyone else. A whimsical tale which requires the reader to suspend disbelief throughout in order for the author to concoct a conclusion that had me laughing out loud. If you’re looking for some escapism from the pandemic this is your book - otherwise, save your pennies."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Stunning,5.0,"I bought this book a while ago because of the media hype, however the reviews were somewhat conflicting which is why it’s taken so long to read it.  WOW! Total emotional roller coaster. Fell in love with the characters, the book is so beautifully written and is so visual, don’t know if there are any plans for a movie? Would make a great one. Totally recommend can’t wait for the next book by this author."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Who knew words could paint such stunning pictures?,4.0,"Incredible. I couldn't quite get into it at first but I persisted because there was something about the story, the writing and how well the author describes everything, as if you were really there and it's stunningly beautiful, that made me not want to give up quite yet. I was not disappointed. I found myself rooting for the characters, smiling and close to tears at several points in the story. Delia Owens paints absolutely stunning pictures in Where The Crawdads sing and this is definitely one I will never forget."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A memorable book,5.0,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is a bit slow to start with, but when you get into the book, it is unputdownable.It is one of those books, that stays with you. I have recommended it to friends as it so good. One friend wants me to pass it onto her, BUT i want the book back as it is one I would like to keep. (There is not many I like to hold onto!)"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Mixed feelings,3.0,"I was looking forward to reading this one for so long and heard such good things, but had very mixed feelings, some nice evocation of the natural world and environment, but some important parts of the story were so very rushed when I wanted them explored much more carefully and needed more depth, especially the family estrangement, other parts really dragged along when I wanted it to move on, and sometimes it irritated me."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Great descriptions but unbelievable story,3.0,"If I could, I'd have given this book five stars for wonderful descriptions of the marsh where our heroine, Kya, lives and for making me feel the claustrophobia of the inland waterways and the freshness of the sea when Kya went out in her boat. Kya loves nature and all things natural and I'm certain the author does too because her enthusiasm for the scenery and its wildlife is what brings this book alive.But the characterisation is cliched in the extreme and the storyline is unbelievable to the point of making me struggle to finish the book because it's so frustratingly cliched and naff. If you're the kind of person, like me, who likes their books grounded in reality, then I'd recommend approaching this as a fairytale set in an unusual and beautifully described setting, that's probably the best way to approach this."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Try it...you will not be disappointed,5.0,"I find it difficult to believe that some readers failed to enjoy this book....I thought it was an absolute masterpiece!A six year old is left abandoned by her family and has to fend for herself in the swamps and marshes of Carolina.Her story, though deeply sad and haunting, is believable and thought provoking.The descriptions of wildlife is exceptional and well worth reading.Unputdownable...."
Where the Crawdads Sing,I never wanted this book to end,5.0,"This is the most wonderful book I have read for a long time.  I deliberately took it slowly, savouring the beautiful, vivid descriptions of the swamps and wildlife.  The characters are totally believable and I felt for Kya as if she were my own daughter.  It is beautifully structured with the movements forwards and backwards in time.  The plot unfolds gradually and you are left in suspense until the very last moment.I loved it and am so sad that I have finished it.  Only those without a soul will not enjoy this incredible first novel.  Thank you Delia Owens!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,What does Kya learn from the marsh?,5.0,"I was given this book as a birthday present.Kya, the marsh girl, experiences betrayal by so many people. She is laughed at and never allowed to join ‘normal’ society. When there is a murder in the area who will be accused? This is a beautifully written book about a girl who experiences isolation but finds beauty and comfort in nature. I’d highly recommend."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Sad and haunting tale,5.0,I read this story feeling a depth of emotions. It is a very sad and haunting tale following the life of a girl who feels wrong prejudice  from the town she lives in and all she did was lose her family and carry on trying to make a life in the marshes where her family home was.I can't recommend this enough!. You must read it!!
Where the Crawdads Sing,Nature versus narrative,3.0,"The author certainly has an eye and way with words when detailing the natural world, but for me the dialogue and story-telling were quite poor (Pedestrian prose, questionable poetry and unrealistic plot - including the court case  which inevitably lead to a conclusion drained of emotional power unless you enjoy the mawkish kind) - suprisingly so in contrast to some of the more beautiful  descriptive passages depicting the local flora and fauna.  Shame, as I was seduced for the first third but fell out of love as plot/character began to lose credibility... still I'm clearly in the minority here so you may want to give it a try..."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A book about human and animal life and love. Superb!,5.0,"My wife had recently read this book, and she recommended I do the same. I rarely read my wife's books but I thought I'd give it a chance, and I'm glad I did. It written in a very deep and descriptive way, a little like Anita Shreve. I found it very enjoyable, I didn't want it to end. I hope they choose the right director and cast for the film. A superb read."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Dialog from a toddler!,3.0,"Great story. Great characters. Well described scenes.  Sadly, this is as far as it goes. The dialog is infantile in its naivety. Frankly laughable conversations go on throughout the book. I simply can’t recommend this book to any lover of novels. At best, it’s just a bit of a daft distraction.  At worst, it’s a waste of time and money."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Far and away one of the best books, if not THE best book I have ever read",5.0,"Simply had to write a review for this book. Far and away one of the best books, if not THE best book I have ever read. Everything about it is simply beautiful and I can’t ever remember a book that made me feel so emotional and connected to a character. A truly moving and captivating story that transports you straight back in time to the marsh lands of the North Carolina coastline. I loved this book so much and I think I loved Kya even more. If you haven’t read this already, then please do. I promise it won’t disappoint."
Where the Crawdads Sing,One of my favourite books this year...,5.0,"I put off reading this book for a long time, as it was being hyped everywhere and I didn't want to be disappointed but I'm so pleased I got over my inhibitions and just read it. It was such a good read, beautifully portrayed, and written in an eloquent style that really matched the slow passage of time in Kya's rural life. It's sold as a murder mystery, with the supposed killer made very obvious from the start. Whilst I love a good 'who dunnit' I was pleased that the murder was not the sole focus of the book, but rather we learn more about the life of the marsh girl and how she survives and thrives in her world. It was both brutal and brilliant, and I would heartily recommend it!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Compelling story,5.0,"I’d heard a lot about this book and wasn’t sure it sounded like my kind of thing but decided to give it a try. I’m so glad I did! I found it a bit slow at first and as a British reader I found it difficult to get my head around the accents but I stuck with it and ended up being totally hooked by the story, the prose and the character of Kya. It’s not like anything I’ve read before and it’s difficult to compare with anything else... it’s a murder mystery, but also a love story, it’s kind of mystical and compelling. It has ended up being one of my favourite books I’ve ever read."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Audible book,5.0,I have never considered Audible books before but I took advantage of an offer and I can honestly say it added a certain something to an extraordinary book. Possibly hearing the accent added an extra dimension ?? One of the best books I have ever read/listened to and I would recommend it to everyone.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Unputdownable,5.0,"Disregarding the obvious suspension of reality that creates the initial vehicle for the story, which I forgive, this is a beautiful book.  The writing and imagery is stunning and the artistry of the whole is something rare.A lovely work and would cause much discussion at a book club.Beautiful."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Best read for a while!,5.0,"I understand where people who think this book is rubbish are coming from! However I found it well written, knowledgeable and  quite gripping. It’s the first book in a long time to reduce me to tears and unlike some I found it quite believable.  I would read another by this author without a doubt."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Highly original and engaging.,4.0,"Slightly slow to 'warm up' but stick with it as you are gradually drawn in to the place and time the story is set. Kya is hard to identify with at first, but the reader begins to feel an affinity for her as you are drawn into her unique circumstances and the mystery surrounding the death of her former lover. By the end of the book, I was really rooting for her and feeling admiration for the life she had made for herself against the odds. Atmospheric and engaging."
Where the Crawdads Sing,rendingly beautiful book!,5.0,"This book is in a class of its own.  Somehow Delia Owen's words sing through your veins as you read it. It is a song to nature, to the naked soul and the storyline is exquisite, the two main characters strong and credible, yet other-worldly at the same time.  I will take a pause, then read it again...."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Average,2.0,"Plot has been summarised in many other reviews and at times was quite compelling. However the overly poetic, flowery descriptions throughout were too much for me and I sometimes felt I was reading a Mills & Boon. It’s a murder mystery in part and that’s what kept me going to the end - which felt a little predictable."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A modern classic,5.0,"This book is so exquisitely written, I have never read anything that depicts the beauty of nature so vividly and in such sharp contrast to the ugliness of human behaviour. The parallels between the natural world and the human world are very poetically and subtly conveyed. It is a very moving tale of one woman’s bravery and refusal to be a victim and I absolutely could not put it down. It felt like I was reading a modern classic. I hope the movie makers do it justice."
Where the Crawdads Sing,When the reader sings,4.0,"Always sucked in to novels set in the Deep South.  At this time of virus isolation, looking forward to reading a novel that pulls you in, stirs your reactions, makes you a little more than just another reader.  This novel has so many reviews, you don't want anything more from me."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Awful!,1.0,"I had high hopes initially given the reviews and after seeing this book everywhere! Oh dear! Cliched story of po’ white trash with a drunken daddy and abandoned by the rest of her family, who raises herself out of the swamp only to be accused of the murder of a local ne’er do well. I’m afraid the ending was predictable and the writing very much inspired by Harper Lee but no where near as articulate, sensitive or gripping. I’m glad I didn’t buy this book (lent to me by a neighbour) but wish I’d used the time to read something better!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Loved this compelling and original novel,5.0,"What a fantastic read this was. I sat up until 2am to finish it I just couldn't put it down. Such an unusual setting and written in a way that made you feel as if you were there. I loved it. Sad poignant and uplifting all at the same time. I recommend you ignore the bad reviews of those that ""didnt get it"" and see for yourself into the life of Kya Clark."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Complete escapism!,5.0,"I loved this book! Yes, the plot is somewhat unlikely, but the description of the world inhabited by the Marsh Girl was nothing short of inspiring. I have to say, I was not a fan of Ms Owens’ grammatically incorrect descriptive sentences. Jarring, cringe-worthy and far too frequent. Call me old-fashioned, but I thought sentences were supposed to contain a verb? Despite this annoying style, the book fully deserves its five stars for its beautiful portrayal of a solitary girl who was able to live happily with gulls as friends and who had nothing but the pursuit of a complete understanding of her environment for fulfilment."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Disappointing,2.0,"I was expecting a fabulous, fast page turner, after reading the reviews from the online book club. Unfortunalty, it was not to be. It was a slow plodding story."
Where the Crawdads Sing,An emotional beautiful read,5.0,"Such an emotional read. Beautifully written with such vivid descriptions of Kya and her home. A story of survival, grief and hope. I lived through every step of her journey and willed her to succeed. This is the kind of story that will stay with me for a long time."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautiful Book,5.0,"What can I say, an absolutely beautiful read.  One of the best books I've read since Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine, where you quickly fall in love with the main character.  Really didn't want this book to end.  It got me through Lock down!  The author is a nature lover and writer, and it shows.  Very beautifully written."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A must-read!,5.0,"I absolutely loved this debut novel by Delia Owens. She is so insightful about all things nature; which is beautifully woven throughout the story. Kya's compelling story is one of strength and endurance and shows how connected we all are to nature and the world aroundus.  Delia's portrayal of little Kya 's character right through to adulthood is so so well done that I had to remind myself many times that it was fiction. I found the book heartbreaking, heartwarming and inspiring all at the same time. I just wish she had another novel to quench my thirst for more."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautiful and emotive storytelling at it’s best,5.0,I felt compelled to write a review after the most recent negative ones were at risk of putting people of reading this novel.As a journalist and editor I can truly say this was a poetic read and a masterclass of simple yet stunningly evocative writing.I was fully immersed in the story from the first page and felt like I was reading a novel that would be talked about for decades to come.It was a joy to read and I cried real tears when it came to an end. I haven’t read a book like this in a long time and I would encourage anyone debating it to give it a shot.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Such a good book!,5.0,I’m not one to read novels as I feel they are all very predictable. This book is amazing. I literally could not put it down. It has such a original story unlike any other book or film I have seen before. The writing is beautiful and the book has twists and turns you could not predict. I loved it.
Where the Crawdads Sing,A beautiful story in every way,5.0,"Such a wonderful book.  If I am reading a book, I will skip descriptions (boring!), and being an Audio book, I almost didn’t purchase it because the description is that the book is full of descriptive script.  So glad I got it because it was such a beautifully written book - I loved the story and the words in between.  Wish it didn’t end!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Disappointed,2.0,"Found the story unbelievable, albeit well written. Rolled my eyes a lot whole reading, but I did finish it so it wasn't terrible. Struggling to understand the hype so perhaps I'm missing something, but I just found the people so unrealistic, and too neatly packaged as Good or Bad. Not for me."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Good read,5.0,Finally decided to read this book after picking it up and putting it down so many times. Took a while to get into it but so glad I persevered as I loved it and didn't want it to end. Think it's a book you will either love or hate but definitely give it a chance.
Where the Crawdads Sing,A magnificent read,5.0,"This is the best book I have read in ages, so wonderfully descriptive you can feel the humidity and smell the atmosphere.  I couldn't put it down, a story that is so beautiful, touching and sad with a twist at the end and although I guessed it I wept and wept when I finished it.  Buy it you won't be disappointed."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Not good,2.0,Am shocked at all the five star reviews. This book is extremely far fetched with loads of unexplained storylines. It drags on and I was ready to scream at the end because of its slowness. I'm giving it two stars because of the basic idea but really it's not good x
Where the Crawdads Sing,READ THIS BOOK - TODAY!,5.0,"Now this is how you write a book! truly beautifully written. I don't usually give long or character reviews , but Kya deserves to be noted.  Unputdownable . I loved every word written. Ms Owens has an amazing talent. I am still sad that the book is finished"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Best book I’ve read in years!,5.0,"Without giving too much away, this has a bit of a To Kill A Mockingbird’ vibe about it and o adored it. As much as I love reading a book that is so exceptional, I hated it when it ended as I felt lost without it- I was completely immersed into this world and wasn’t ready to leave. Also, just when I was worried that the ending was going to be a bit too easy, the author came through in the last through pages and smashed by doubts with an excellent ending that fitted the novel perfectly. I adored everything about this!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,A *Marmite' book - love it or hate it,4.0,"Utterly captivating, unputdownable, that's how I found it.  Strong characters, utterly convincing environment, gripping story.  Why haven't I given it 5 stars? Well, it is fiction but even so it is rather unbelievable if you care to dig deeper than the shallow. Feral child, however bright, is unlikely to self-teach biology to that level and Really could she have written those books? From a 'noble savage' aspect it works but probably goes too far for the sake of the story. The reviews already show that people love it or hate it and I totally get that."
Where the Crawdads Sing,One of the best books I’ve read in a long time.,5.0,"I loved this book. I thought the prose was stunning and the descriptions of the marsh land really took me into the main character’s world. There was also a page turning plot to go with the beautiful writing.I literally found it hard to put the book down and intend to read it again , which I rarely do with any novel! A truly remarkable read."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A compelling read.,5.0,"Couldn’t put it down! I became so absorbed in the characters I found myself worrying about them when I wasn’t reading! I had to know what happened next. A beautiful, sad, compelling and poignant story which is told with true skill and flair.  A must read!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,A great read,5.0,"I really loved the book.It's sad at the beginning when the father is beating everyone. It's sad when Kay is on her own.Her life in the swamp, is also sad, her being on her own.But it's also full of love. Her love of the swamp, her love for Tate and Jumpy."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Beautiful, emotive read",5.0,"loved this book, beautifully written and a wonderful story that has twists and turns right until the end. It truly transports you to the marsh land setting and a different time where poverty and prejudice were rife leading to the isolation of a little girl. I really enjoyed that this story walked us through her whole life not just leaving us wondering when the main thrust of the novel was worked through.Definitworth a read."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A pleasant listen,5.0,"Throughly enjoyed delving into another part of the world with this novel on Audible. I couldn’t stop listening to it while I had a young baby to care for at home during lockdown. It helped pass the days and take me to another place, with the lovely voice of the narrator and interesting story."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Brilliant read,5.0,"Excellent  book, not my usual but I really enjoyed it.  A lot of description around the marshes and wildlife etc which was great. Also highlighted prejudices we build up before we give people a chance.  Should be made into a film."
Where the Crawdads Sing,The  book is a story with some learning of great interest.,5.0,"I loved this book . Some people seem to have mistaken it for history  or geography.It is a Story. There are plenty of books where things are not possible.  Films also. Sky Trek and oo7 films,for instance. Actors are mistaken for world savers!  If only that were true."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Not for me,3.0,"I heard so many reviews about this book good a d bad. My opinion is I didn't enjoy it at all, I wasn't unimpressed with the dialogue and the plot was nothing to write home about, sorry not for me. But I'm sure there will and are people who think its wonderful."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A superb and astounding read,5.0,"Beautifully written, refreshing , captivating with a poignant ending that leaves you reflecting long after the pages .So descriptive was the narrative my escapism to the marsh and its wildlife felt very real ..A fantastic and unique storyline ...one of the best novels of the year .."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Very moving,5.0,"I thought that this was a very moving, emotional novel. I thought that it was very sad in places,especially how everyone left Kya to survive on her own. Its a beautiful love story as well as a mystery. The descriptions of the scenery is really moving and vivid.  I enjoyed it very much."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Touching, beautifully written - literary fiction at it's best",5.0,"Such a gorgeous book, recommend it to anyone. A mysterious death is the underlying story running through this novel, but the book is so much more. Kya Clark, known as the Marsh Girl raises herself in her patch of marsh in Northern Carolina. Kya can rely on few people, but some are on her side.Her story is touchingly and beautifully written. Delia Clark's story will stay with me for a long time. One of the best books I've read in a long time."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Brilliant book!!!!,5.0,This book was very well written - so much so that I could picture in my mind's eye every detail of the marsh and the creatures that lived there. It's not often that I write a review but I really enjoyed reading it so I felt that I had to write something.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Beautiful masterpiece,5.0,This is a perfect bildungsroman - love story - crime story and guide to naturalism all in one. I loved the vivid descriptions of the marsh and natural world of North Carolina. Through this novel I got to inhabit a world I will never physically see but one that I now know so well in my imagination.
Where the Crawdads Sing,"41k + reviews for a reason. A Brilliant, and Beautiful Book!",5.0,"Reading the description didn’t make want to read this book, it was the sheer number of reviews. And I’m so glad I did. This has gone to my number 1 spot of books read ever. Beautifully descriptive, takes you to the marsh itself. Highly recommend a read."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Badly written,2.0,"This could have been an interesting story but sadly it is so badly written that any potential is lost.  The central character. Kya, is made up of every cliche going.  And the other characters are very one dimensional.  A real disappointment."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Wonderful!,5.0,"I loved this story. Beautiful descriptions of life and nature in the marsh, a wonderful character in Kya and an intriguing mystery too. Listened on Audible and loved the narrator's soothing, gentle voice."
Where the Crawdads Sing,An exceptional book,5.0,One of the best books I have ever read in my 74 years.  Very enjoyable  and hard to put down.  The story telling was fantastic and the wildlife information tremendous.  I feel I have learnt a lot!
Where the Crawdads Sing,a beautifully written book,5.0,"I love this book, such an interesting read, the nature descriptions come to life. (of course the author knows her nature).  This will stay in my mind for a long time.  Really like all the characters especially Jumpin'."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A wonderful book,5.0,"I’ve been waiting a long time to read this book and it didn’t disappoint. I made sure not to read a single review or any details about it, so that it didn’t need to ‘live up to the hype.’  It’s beautifully written and I’m almost sad to have finished it."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A good story,5.0,I'm giving this 5 stars because I read it in one day; that's how addictive I found it. I agree with all the bad reviews too but as a story it swept along and kept me interested all through.
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Not bad, not brilliant.",3.0,"An absorbing book, starts off well so that you want to continue. Good writing, the descriptions are beautiful but sometimes repetitive and not always relevant. Characters and plot not well developed at all."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"A must read, wonderful book",5.0,"I have just finished this fantastic book. I loved it from start to finish. Beautifully written and completely absorbing. I couldn’t recommend this highly enough, best book this year and I’ve read plenty."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"A wonderful, lyrical story. Outstanding.",5.0,"I guess That I can't add much to the praise already heaped on this book It is simply the best novel I've read in years.Utterly believable, beautifully written and a credit to the author."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Wonderfully compelling...,5.0,"I found this a little difficult to get into at first, but later found it so compelling I struggled to put it down. Wonderful characters and story, and an impressive debut by the author."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Better than expected for such an over-hyped novel,4.0,"I borrowed this book from the library as I truly expected to ditch it by 50 pages in.  But it was a good read, an engaging story and I liked the ending even though it made me cry (and that's rare). It is over-hyped as it's nothing amazing, just a good read."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Where The Crawdads Sing,5.0,This is one of the best novels that I have ever read and I would like to congratulate it this talented author and thank her for the many hours of pleasure reading this book gave me.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Superbly written.,5.0,"An excellent read, superb insight into human feelings and relationships. Once started it's difficult to put down. I was swept along with 'the marsh girl' and her isolated lifestyle."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A sensational debut novel. Moving and beautiful,5.0,"I have not been so moved by a book for years. Yes, some of it is a little predictable/unrealistic but it is a classic, heartwarming tale of human survival against all the odds. I found the characters well-developed and exploring the marsh from heroine Kya’s perspective was breathtaking. The author’s writing style and descriptive prose are thought-provoking and fresh and her handling of suspense was excellent. Ms Owens, you have a rare gift and will have touched so many lives with this book! Keep writing!"
Where the Crawdads Sing,Absolutely stunning,5.0,I loved every page of this book. Listened to it on audio and the narrator was perfect. A stunning piece of writing. Huge thanks to the author for the joy I had listening to this.
Where the Crawdads Sing,One of the best novels ever!,5.0,"Really one of the best novels I have ever read.  I literally  could not put  this book  down. The twists and turns and the way the characters are developed is truly astounding. Long after you have finished this book, it will stay with you . The nicest thing I can do is encourage everyone to read this."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Heartbreaking but Beautiful,5.0,"Got this book as a Mother's day gift, was'nt sure what to expect...but I loved it! It was heartbreaking and beautiful both at the same time and I loved the expressive way in which it was written. Well done Delia Owen's I will be looking out for the next novel."
Where the Crawdads Sing,too many plot holes,3.0,easy read but didnt live up to hype. Too many aspects of the plot seemed implausible or far fetched. Overall I liked the writing style although every now and then descriptions of nature felt like lifted directly from a text book which jarred with me.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Ignore the Naysayers - this book is a delight,5.0,"I don't usually write reviews but I thought I would in this case after seeing a few negative reviews, which I thought was a little perplexing. I read a fair amount of fiction and find quite a lot unremarkable if I'm honest. Occasionally I read a gem that is original, gripping and well written and Crawdads ticked all those boxes. I loved it and would encourage others to read it too. My husband read it after me and was equally impressed."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Excellent read,4.0,I’m not going to analyse story lines or how realistic this book is. What I thought was it was a very good read. Able to escape from the tedium of lockdown into a different world.Will recommend it to my friends.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Best book i have read in a long time,5.0,I was recommended this book by book club.  I just loved it. The story line was unusual and the characters were so engaging.  I felt like I was there observing it all from the sidelines.  Great descriptions and believable characters.  I particularly enjoyed the ending.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Absolutely brilliant,5.0,"Loved this audio book so much, I was completely immersed in the story the whole time and could really visualise what was going on. I loved it that much I want to buy the actual book for my bookshelf - a must read/listen! Fantastic story and setting."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Great read!,5.0,"This is a great read, a coming of age story about the Marsh Girl. I felt sorry for Kya, her parents were terrible and just left her to fend for herself.I enjoyed the relationship she had with nature but at times I felt the book was a little bit drawn out.Thanks to NetGalley for my copy."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Compelling & beautifully written,5.0,"I’m 3/4 the way through. It’s brilliant & beautifully written. Am listening via audible & the narrator is clear. If only I hadn’t woken up half way through the night & felt compelled to listen to more! Am tired now, but keen to hear more."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Just read it!,5.0,"I loved everything about this book. The writing, the imagery, it made my heart sing, pound and knot. Best book for a long time, really not sure what I can read next that can possibly be as good."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Didn't enjoy.,2.0,"I found the reader's voice irritating .Her accent was so strong,that I found it difficult and unpleasant to listen to.I might try reading the book instead."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Brilliant book. beautifully written,5.0,This book isn't the kind of book I usually read but i gave it a go and am just blown away. Stunning writing especially for a debut book plus the story line is gripping. Highly recommended. Congratulations Delia Owens.
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Beautifully written, atmospheric and glides along.",5.0,I havnt been able to 'Get into' a book for ages..  This was fantastic. Read it in three sittings and miss it. Beautifully written and best ending. Highly recommend.  Jan
Where the Crawdads Sing,Amazing read,5.0,"This is such a solidly great book. Every aspect, writing, character development, story, layout, buildup, ending, everything is executed wonderfully. It's been a long time I've enjoyed a book this much and expect it to grow into an American classic. I hope to see more from this author."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Didn’t want it to end 😢,5.0,"This is one of my favourite books of 2020. I had seen so many people review it and rate it highly, I felt I needed to see for myself.I totally fell in love with Kya as The Marsh Girl  and the relationships she had with people. I did not want to put this beautifully written book down. A tissue was used a few times to wipe away the tears."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Lovely - but cut the last 4 pages!,4.0,"I enjoyed the book, particularly the descriptions of the marsh, and Kay’s loneliness and connection with nature. BUT I was quite disappointed by that last 3 pages. They felt unnecessary to me and took the edge of a story and characters I had become quite emotionally invested in. I had loved the book up until the last couple of pages and wished it had finished on page 360! Still a lovely read though."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Fascinating novel,5.0,"A wonderful work of art. Beautifully read. in appropriate Carolina voice.  Particularly enjoyed as it appealed for its environmental subject matter, emotional tension and the fact that some of my family live on the Eastern Shore, USA. The terrain was well known to me and extremely well captured in words and tone. Deep, sensitive and evocative."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Well you either love it or you hate it,4.0,I loved it - wonderfully evocative writing with a good story thrown in - ok so Kya's lifestyle might seem a bit implausible to some but so what - it's a story and one that starts in 1952 - a work of fiction - and it doesn't claim to be anything else. Loved the poems too.  Look forward to the film and future books by this author.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Good read once you get into the first chapter.....,4.0,"Murder mystery and coming of age novel, found it hard to get into but stuck with it and really enjoyed it.  I actually found it hard to put down then once I got into it.  I read it on recommendation (not Amazon), seen it advertised in many places and the cover appealed to me (if that’s a reason to read a book 😄)."
Where the Crawdads Sing,"Unusual story, beautifully told.",5.0,This was such a beautifully written book. The natural world really came to life in relaying the tale of a gentle character hurt by the world but healed by the swamps which were her home.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Great Fiction,5.0,Best book I’ve read in ages.For those of you that love reading I highly recommendA coming-of-age story love story with a murder-mystery plot.  A story of resilience.Set on the North Carolina Coast in 50s /60s❤️📚❤️
Where the Crawdads Sing,Massive holes in the plot,2.0,"I loved the descriptive writing in this book and felt I was transported to the swamp. I also quite liked some of the characters. Unfortunately, the holes in the plot were so big you could drive a double-decker bus through them. However beautifully written, a story that just doesn’t hold together is ultimately frustrating. Such a shame."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Chessy,2.0,"I heard so many good reviews of this book, Why??????It annoyed me intensely, girl meets boy, dullness, in a swamp with a few  seagulls thrown in. YawnNothing new here."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Looks interesting.  An extra little gift.,5.0,This is an extra gift for someone. I liked the book cover and the name. It’s set in a different location that should make it an interesting read.
Where the Crawdads Sing,A page turner that reminded me of Mockingbird,4.0,"I was hesitant to read this book as I never read Richard and Judy book club books, however, I am so glad I did! It is well-written and a real page turner. The Southern dialect in the dialogue is spot-on. The 1950s setting and court case reminded me a bit of Harper Lee's 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. Really interesting main character. Definitely recommend this as a summer read."

Where the Crawdads Sing,A tale of survival,5.0,"I kept seeing this book pop up on Amazon (some might argue that's just good marketing!), and the cover drew me in, it intrigued me to find out what it was about. I have to say I have read a lot but never read anything like this book. I kept reading into the night to find out what happened next. Some parts of the book were slow and it's hard to believe a child could be left to fend for themselves but that's exactly what happened here with Kya.Feeling safe a lot of the time but sometimes vulnerable, I would say you easily slip into Kya's shoes ... but she didn't actually have any and even went shopping bare foot. Her resourcefulness was impressive and it was amazing to witness her as she bloomed into a woman and then  beyond.If you want a book to take you on a journey then this is for you, it's a true escape and sometimes it turns ugly but from the dead body on the very first page, I was hooked on this novel. It made me question what is actually important in life, how to escape the rat race and also how important it is to do things that make you happy."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Breathtakingly beautiful,5.0,"'What d'ya mean, where the crawdads sing? ...... 'Just means far in the bush where critters are wild, still behaving like critters...' _____ Delia OwensA breathtakingly beautifully crafted, emotional story that simply draws the reader in and takes them on a journey through nature, through marshland, through the eyes of the 'Marsh Girl'. Wonderful characterisation and rich descriptions make this a book to be cherished and adored."
Where the Crawdads Sing,A wonderful read!,5.0,"This has to be one of my favourite books that I have read in recent times. It has so many strengths to it, being part love story, part mystery, part biology treat. I originally read this on Kindle, but have now bought the book as want to highlight so many things to share with others. It really shines through that the authoress is an expert biologist, and without giving anything away, it has a twist to it."
Where the Crawdads Sing,Brilliant,5.0,Exceptional writing and a brilliant story. I felt Kya's isolation - I felt her longing to be included - I felt her passion for nature - I felt her loves and I felt her pain. Written with such detail as to capture each stage of her life - this is an exquisite book about the Marsh Girl.I will probably read it all over again.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Loved this book,5.0,This book brought memories of To Kill A Mockingbird and how the south can be a cruel place. I wanted Kya to succeed after having such a tough start in life and found myself emotionally involved in the story. Tears were flowing from me at various points in the story. Fabulous read.
Where the Crawdads Sing,I loved this book!,5.0,Someone told me about this book from start to finish and I still bought it. I loved the descriptions of nature and even though I knew the end it didn't spoil the overall picture for me. I would have liked to read more about Kya and Tate's life together but apart from that I enjoyed it.
Where the Crawdads Sing,Highly recommended,5.0,"I love this book and hope the film does it justice. I don’t want to write a  ‘worthy’ review as there is so much to say. It is endearing, sensitive, painful and emotional but also beautifully written and totally compelling. Read it and enjoy!"

Where the Crawdads Sing,FIVE STAR REVIEW (@crosslingreads),5.0,"Delia Owens: Where the Crawdads Sing.*“I wasn't aware that words could hold so much. I didn't know a sentence could be so full.”⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️This book was perfect.📚The descriptions were beautiful and immersive. I’ve never been in marshland, yet I feel like I can picture exactly Kya’s shack and the landscape she calls home. Owen’s attention to detail was astounding. The intense, descriptive language slowed down the pace of the story- while it made reading slower, I don’t necessarily think it’s a bad thing.📚I thought the use of time was really interesting. The novel moves across the years, between 1952 and 1970, bouncing back and forth and skipping many months at a time. If I’m honest, I didn’t pay close attention to the actual months and years. They were noted as chapter headers, but I think the passage of time was evident from the writing itself, and most of the time I was so invested in the storyline that I didn’t look away from the actual body of the text. It worked really well though, and provided a really interesting insight into why Kya is the way that she is.📚On Kya: she is definitely one of my favourite female protagonists of all time. She was strong and smart, which I liked, and her flaws, fears and struggles evoked an emotional response from me. I was sad and worried and frustrated for Kya, and wanted her to be safe and happy, which I think is a clear sign of a well-written character (or I’m just overly-invested, oops).📚I loved the ending. It was the happy ending I always crave, made bittersweet with death, continuously exciting with the satisfying reveal of secrets, and an easy finality. I put the book down and was really, deeply happy."

Where the Crawdads Sing,"Enjoyable, albeit forgettable.",3.0,"Kya is left abandoned as a child in her family’s shack of a house out in the marshes of North Carolina. ‘Swamp girl’ or ‘Swamp trash’ is how the locals in the nearest town refer to her.She lives out the majority of her adolescence and 20’s in solitude and isolation, never going to school, with only the local gulls as company, and occasionally a visit from Tate, a friend of her departed brother.The story covers the formative years of Kya’s life, how she survives and thrives in her own little world and also her dalliances with love and desire.The story moves back and forth in time and we know from an early stage there is a sinister tale in the making.The story was an enjoyable intrigue and Owens did well to create a sense of being back in these marshlands of 1950-60’s North Carolina.However, the language seemed at times a bit overwrought for my liking although that could in part be due to the languid drawl of the narrator (I listened to the audiobook), which I’m sure is an authentic Carolina accent, but I found it distracting, and even irritating at times.Overall though it was a pleasant read but not one I imagine I will remember for too long."
Where the Crawdads Sing,My Favourite Book of 2019,5.0,I read this book last year and I loved it SO much. It was surprising and captivating and the characters were so rich.
